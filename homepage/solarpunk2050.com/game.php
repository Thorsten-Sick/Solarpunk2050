    This game is fast paced, a bit silly and a bit wise. It will drag you and your players through a campaign of Solarpunk rebuild. Uncovering the dark secret behind the myth of the  "Eat the rich festivals" ( where no rich person has been eaten).
    As this campaign starts with two sandboxed tutorial missions to introduce the world you can start playing without reading the whole book. Those missions contain ready-to-play characters.

    <h2>Getting started</h2>
    Start this campaign with the first tutorial adventure "The world destroying machine" for <a href="shop.php#free">free</a>
.

    <h1>Rules</h1>

    It is build on the FATE system (FATE condensed). Which puts a focus on character aspects and supports you playing a complex personality with some difficulties - someone who rocks when it is time to push all the hard earned FATE markers to the table center together with your team.
