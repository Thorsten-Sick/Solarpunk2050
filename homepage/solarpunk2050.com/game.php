    <h1>Solarpunk 2050</h1>

    In the year 2050 people found several ways to find a perfect balance between society, technology and nature. And everything promises to be so much better than ever before.

    2050 is the core year of the Solarpunk revolution. And with three philosophies to pick from it is not certain which utopia will be built. The gamer characters will be from all those philosophies and will have to find their own mix while saving the day.

    <ul>
    <li> The Pioneers are mad scientists building very temporary prototypes. Party and progress is their element</li>
    <li> The Norms have automated Hive cities where technology feels like magic. Thanks to their Hive controller they are always connected - as long as they have Wifi</li>
    <li> The Lost abandoned all technology that contains microcontrollers. They know the past, how to survive the rough nature and protect their treasure: books</li>
    </ul>

    The game is fast paced, a bit silly and a bit wise.

    <h1>Rules</h1>

    It is build on the FATE system (FATE condensed). Which puts a focus on character aspects and supports you playing a complex personality with some difficulties - someone who rocks when it is time to push all the hard earned FATE markers to the table center together with your team.
