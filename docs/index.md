## Welcome to Solarpunk 2050 - a FATE setting

Solarpunk is hope.

Solarpunk 2050 is a TTRPG setting for Fate.

After several catastrophes, the remaining humans have managed to bootstrap a new civilisation. More precisely: Three new philosophies for a good and sustainable life. But the transformation is not yet complete. The protagonists will face many challenges to finish what humanity has started. Their greatest advantage: They are diverse.

* The Lost are guardians of the past and experts in survival.
* The Norms lead perfect cooperation in modern AI-controlled hives.
* And the Pioneers are pushing humanity forward with their bold application of science.

This Solarpunk setting will help you immerse yourself in this new world.
