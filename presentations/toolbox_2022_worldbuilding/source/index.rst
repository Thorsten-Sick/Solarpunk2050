Solarpunk
=========

Worldbuilding
=============

Worldbible
----------

Many franchises have that. A secret book of background info only writers have access to.
Think: Star Wars, Star Trek. This is also why Fanfiction fails to perfectly blend in

Functioning world
-----------------

The world must function. Or the players can hack it somehow or the suspension of disbelief fails

A world where players want to live in
-------------------------------------

Solarpunk is a positive world. But different people have different tastes. 

3 Shades of Solarpunk

A unfinished world
------------------

A perfect Solarpunk world would not offer satisfaction by solving issues

An accessible world
-------------------

I played cool RPG settings with so complex internals that everyone spent the evening discussing and guessing...

A world with different issues
-----------------------------

I played cool RPG settings with only 2-3 major storys that can be played....

RPG levels
==========

Rules
-----

Rules define the play style. FATE is heavy on drama, still has rules for fights, social and skills

Setting
-------

This is built in this worldbuilding. Many rules already include a setting. Or you can buy those as books.


Adventure
---------

Characters
----------

Three factions to offer different perspectives. And make different player types happy.

* Lost: Fighters and adventurerers
* Norms: Wizards and allrounder
* Progressives: Mad science, creativity

Also: Mixing them in an adventure group causes interaction. Which is good.

The game being played
---------------------

Goal
====

* Playable world
* Inspiring people
* Postivity

Playable world
--------------

* Imaginable adventures must be possible
* Different player types
* GMs must be able to create adventures
* Players must be able to navigate the world
* Players must be able to create characters

Inspiring people
----------------

Goal is to inspire people and give them a positive vision of the future

Positivity
----------

Solarpunk is about a positive future. Keep as much as possible of that alive while still offering adventure

Learning by doing
=================

I decided to explore Solarpunk more than inventing it. This is why I keep playing with different people and do brainstorming

Lessons learned
===============

Not everyone is sparkly
-----------------------

A player wanted to play a Solarpunk outsider

Not everyone is creative
------------------------

Hacker mentality can not be simulated at the table. Give them alternatives

Back to the dirty past
----------------------

Advanced Solarpunk societies are to perfect. So the time frame "In the middle of the revolution" is better

Start simple
------------

Add more options and character depths as optional and later. People are already overwhelmed by a positive world

Tutorial style
--------------

In the old days we read 3 books before we started playing....now we have tutorials

Books
=====

* Kobold Guide to Worldbuilding
* Robin's laws
* Spielleiten
* Abenteuer gestalten

Tools
=====

* The story engine

Contribution
============

It is open source. I need:
--------------------------

* Characters
* Adventures
* Spell check
* Content check
* Images
* Publicity

Publishing
----------

I want as many players as possible. Currently checking out some traditional RPG publishers
