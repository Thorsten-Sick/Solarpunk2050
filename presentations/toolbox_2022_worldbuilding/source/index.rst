Solarpunk 2050
==============

Worldbuilding
=============

Worldbible
----------

Many franchises have that. A secret book of background info only writers have access to.
Think: Star Wars, Star Trek. This is also why Fanfiction fails to perfectly blend in

Functioning world
-----------------

The world must function. Or the players can hack it somehow or the suspension of disbelief fails

A world where players want to live in
-------------------------------------

Solarpunk is a positive world. But different people have different tastes.

3 Shades of Solarpunk (Norm, Lost, Progressives)

A unfinished world
------------------

A perfect Solarpunk world would not offer satisfaction by solving issues

An accessible world
-------------------

I played cool RPG settings with mega complex world internals that everyone spent the evening discussing and guessing...we can do better

A world with different issues
-----------------------------

I played cool RPG settings with only 2-3 major storys that can be played....this is not enough !

Seeds for stories
-----------------

Seeds are tech podacsts. I exagerate the introduced technology, maybe assign it to a Faction. The bad parts go into the obstacle section. The good parts are made awesome and become goals for the players

Society is larger than tech
---------------------------

In SF and especially the *punk SF society is much mor important than tech. And in TTRPGs society topics are simpler to play with.

Fate ans Solarpunk
------------------

I picked a story centered TTRPG (Fate) and no tactical or crunchy. Because I want to focus on humand interaction.

RPG levels
==========

Role playing games are unfinished stories. The players and the GM are in charge.
There are different levels of pre-prepared stuff for the GM presenting the world to the players.

Rules
-----

Rules define the play style. FATE is heavy on drama, still has rules for fights, social and skills

Setting
-------

This is built in this worldbuilding. Many rules already include a setting. Or you can buy those as books.


Adventure
---------

Adventure books can be bought. This is how many GMs start. Then:

* Adjust the adventure to the group
* Write own adventures
* Write campaigns


Characters
----------

Three factions to offer different perspectives. And make different player types happy.

* Lost: Fighters and adventurers
* Norms: Wizards and allrounder
* Progressives: Mad science, creativity, nerd

Also: Mixing them in an adventure group causes interaction. Which is good.

The game being played
---------------------

Solarpunk is more towards *character interaction* and *dilemma* than towards tactics and fighting.
There could still be a part of an adventure where fighting is required.

Goal
====

* Playable world
* Inspiring people
* Postivity

Playable world
--------------

* Imaginable adventures must be possible
* Different player types
* GMs must be able to create adventures
* Players must be able to navigate the world
* Players must be able to create characters

Inspiring people
----------------

Goal is to inspire people and give them a positive vision of the future. Extra points if players start discussing the different approaches of the factions the day after playing.

Breaking patterns
-----------------

Stories are built out of "tropes". The tropes used in our stories are very often negative. Break that.

Positivity
----------

Solarpunk is about a positive future. Keep as much as possible of that alive while still offering adventure


3 is magic
----------

In mind storming sessions we try to reach 3 options: After getting there it is much simpler to add even more

3 is more magic
---------------

Three factions can build different alliances and those can change. It is the firt odd number where this can happen


Shatter institutions to generate adventures
===========================================

De-civilize large parts of the world.

Church
------

A schism is great. Kill a pope, unleash the inquisition. And build a modern church in parallel to make everything much more confusing

Governments
-----------

Remove all governments with direct impact. Keep the UN to hand out missions and resource points

Rich people
-----------

"Eat the rich festivals" with a even more shocking truth. Rich people could have prevented all thos catastrophes. The only explanation why they did not: They are gone.

The Orbit
---------

* Kill navigation, communication, weather monitoring - all those things take the adventure out of life
* Kessler syndrome is a good solution

Civilisation
------------

* Large regions of the world should go back to a wild state
* Catastrophes can create different kinds of wilderness

Still existing
--------------

* DIY islands of different flavours of Solarpunk
* This is the size a group of protagonists can influence
* This is the size a group of players can imagine (a comfy sized set of NPCs, ...)

Learning by doing
=================

I decided to explore Solarpunk more than inventing it. This is why I keep playing with different people and do brainstorming

Play adventures
---------------

With different groups

Get pictures
------------

Different styles, different parts of the world

Discuss Solarpunk
-----------------

There are many ideas out there

Build other stuff based on this setting
---------------------------------------

* Stories
* Comics
* Computer games

Factions
========

Pioneers
--------

I added the permission to keep some technologies (up to 8) a secret despite sharing is caring. Because:

* Strengthens individualistic stuff, compared to Norms
* Is a good plot hook

Norms
-----

Lost
----



Lessons learned
===============

Not everyone is a nerd
----------------------

A player wanted to play a Progressive outsider...

Not everyone is creative
------------------------

Hacker mentality can not be simulated at the table. Give them alternative characters to play

Back to the dirty past
----------------------

Advanced Solarpunk societies are to perfect. So the time frame "In the middle of the revolution" is better

Start simple
------------

Add more options and character depths as optional and later. People are already overwhelmed by a positive world

Tutorial style
--------------

In the old days we read 3 books before we started playing....now we have tutorials

Resources
=========

Resources make a good plot hook. Earning, stealing, trading.

Resource points
---------------

* Universal system
* Enforces recycling


Barter
------

* Lost only
* Very basic, no trust in the system required

Different systems for the factions
----------------------------------

* Makes trading more interesting
* Experimenting with options

Basic income
------------

* Every Norm gets basic income
* Free shelves instead a stat on character sheet - perceptible


Meritocracy
-----------

* Progressives fall back to meritocracy.

Plans
=====

Some pieces are still missing

Adventures
----------

We needs 3-4 adventures of different styles

Charakters
----------

A bunch of typical characters

History
-------

A history book. Maybe adventures or plot hooks to play between 2020 and 2050

Gear
----

Players love gear. It also defines the world. Gear can also be philosophies and other non-material stuff

Trouble
-------

Things for the GM to start stories with

* Monsters
* Toxic societies
* Wilderness


Books to read
=============

* Kobold Guide to Worldbuilding
* Robin's laws
* Spielleiten
* Abenteuer gestalten

Tools
=====

* The story engine

Digital Pen & Paper
===================

* Roll 20
* Rule books as PDFs
* Discord enhancements

Whats next
==========

It is open source. I need:
--------------------------

* Characters
* Adventures
* Spell check
* Content check
* Pictures
* Publicity

Publishing
----------

I want as many players as possible. Currently checking out some traditional RPG publishers
