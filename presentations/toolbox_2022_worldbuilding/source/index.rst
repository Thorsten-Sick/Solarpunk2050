Solarpunk
=========

Worldbuilding
=============

Worldbible
----------

Many franchises have that. A secret book of background info only writers have access to.
Think: Star Wars, Star Trek. This is also why Fanfiction fails to perfectly blend in

Functioning world
-----------------

The world must function. Or the players can hack it somehow or the suspension of disbelief fails

A world where players want to live in
-------------------------------------

Solarpunk is a positive world. But different people have different tastes. 

3 Shades of Solarpunk

A unfinished world
------------------

A perfect Solarpunk world would not offer satisfaction by solving issues

An accessible world
-------------------

I played cool RPG settings with so complex internals that everyone spent the evening discussing and guessing...

A world with different issues
-----------------------------

I played cool RPG settings with only 2-3 major storys that can be played....

RPG levels
==========

Role playing games are unfinished stories. The players and the GM are in charge.

Rules
-----

Rules define the play style. FATE is heavy on drama, still has rules for fights, social and skills

Setting
-------

This is built in this worldbuilding. Many rules already include a setting. Or you can buy those as books.


Adventure
---------

Characters
----------

Three factions to offer different perspectives. And make different player types happy.

* Lost: Fighters and adventurerers
* Norms: Wizards and allrounder
* Progressives: Mad science, creativity

Also: Mixing them in an adventure group causes interaction. Which is good.

The game being played
---------------------

Goal
====

* Playable world
* Inspiring people
* Postivity

Playable world
--------------

* Imaginable adventures must be possible
* Different player types
* GMs must be able to create adventures
* Players must be able to navigate the world
* Players must be able to create characters

Inspiring people
----------------

Goal is to inspire people and give them a positive vision of the future

Positivity
----------

Solarpunk is about a positive future. Keep as much as possible of that alive while still offering adventure

Learning by doing
=================

I decided to explore Solarpunk more than inventing it. This is why I keep playing with different people and do brainstorming

Lessons learned
===============

Not everyone is sparkly
-----------------------

A player wanted to play a Solarpunk outsider

Not everyone is creative
------------------------

Hacker mentality can not be simulated at the table. Give them alternatives

Back to the dirty past
----------------------

Advanced Solarpunk societies are to perfect. So the time frame "In the middle of the revolution" is better

Start simple
------------

Add more options and character depths as optional and later. People are already overwhelmed by a positive world

Tutorial style
--------------

In the old days we read 3 books before we started playing....now we have tutorials

Resources
=========

    Scarce resources (those resource points) are a good story hook. You can use it for adventures like expeditions, for loot, or crime stories where criminals try to trick the system to get more resource points. This is also the reason why they can not be traded. It would be to easy that way to trade them for other resources like money.

Resource points
---------------

Barter
------

Basic income
------------

Reason to use the free shelves in the game instead money transfered to the characters account: If just resource points are automatically refreshed and the character is buying stuff with a price tag it will not be part of the game world. This way the player can decide to grab something from the free shelve or pay for something premium. That way the basic income can be experienced. In a real world economy it would be smarter to just transfer a certaina mount of money to someones account and have them decide what to spend that on.

Meritocracy
-----------
