\chapter{The dead Nazi Zombie}
\label{ch:The Dead Nazi Zombie}

\section{Topic}

This is a ciminal investiagation in the entertainment "industry" in Friedrichshafen at the Lake of Constance.
The Norms have lots of entertainment and strange hobbies. In Friedrichshafen that turned into a Wrestling league styled air combat with two teams. On is the "Resistance", the other one "Nazi Zombies".
The planes they are using are electric and can be remote controlled to land when a critical hit is scored. They are designed after WW2 planes.
But being Norms they also do not really understand the real historical situation and the involvement of this town in war crimes.

The story starts when a plane is shot down "for real" and crashes burning into the Lake of Constance. Instead of just triggering the smoke machine and landing by autopilot on the "Loser Runway".
The Hero of the Nazi Zombie team "Herbert Hartfels, der Schlächter der Lüfte", flies a Spitfire.
His Nemesis a Messerschmidt (yes, they really know nothing about history).

The fights are a mixture of military pomp, Wrestling style Kayfabe with hero/villain stories, real action and technology (run by a small team of Pioneers).
The fans (especially the fans of the Zombie team) party in a violent soccer fans mode and those parties are feared by the population. But there are also fans who are able to tell you all the statistics baseball fans style ("64 percent of successful barrel roll escapes by Herbert are left").

There is a simulation league where beginners can train in simulators. They love that.

The job of the job of the protagonists is to solve the crime and try to sort out how Friedrichshafen can have a future with less historical ballast.

If the Protagonists already uncovered the Billionairs from outer space and learned that they have bunkers filled with weapons a "airforce" could be something they would appreciate to have as a backup plan....

\section{What really happened}

No one knows who is playing Herbert Hartfels. People following Kayfabe tend to ignore that there is an actor/athlete behind this persona.
This actor once met a Lost travelling by pleasure barge over the Lake of Constance and the rivers attached to it.
The Lost was shocked by the Nazi Zombie show in Friedrichshafen and explained to the actor the historical links.
Understanding those and seeing the violence of the fans the actor decided to kill the persona. The only way out of this showbusiness.

    \begin{npcDescription}
    An impulsive architect, he has a spire with a house on it. He is trying to cultivate the side of the rock by attaching small boxes for plants.
    He was part of the 5 minute riot that Kim escaped from. Being impulsive, he threw rocks at the three Project Lifeguard people. The cyborg followed Kim. A rock thrown by Leo hit an engineer, throwing him off a bridge and killing him. Sam, the third engineer, was hiding in their bunker. An antenna was destroyed by rocks thrown.
    After the rebellion turned bloody, Leo retreated. Shocked by his own actions.
    If this can be fixed, they can gain the support of a skilled architect who only lacks the tools to build fantastic vertical gardens and bridges.

    Leo is 60 years old and remembers the time before the disaster. He moved to Albstadt 2 years before the disaster. Leo studied engineering and architecture before moving there.

    \textbf{Location:} His own spire. With a small house (repaired). And a small hanging garden at the side of the spire (just some flower pots, he did not have the right tools for proper hanging gardens).

    \textbf{Problem:} Has to deal with killing someone. Maybe talking to Sam will help.

    \textbf{When convinced:} Can help build things (a real hanging garden, real suspension bridges, crab traps)
