\chapter{Settlers}
\label{ch:settlers}

This adventure is less detailed and is aimed at the game master and players with Solarpunk 2050 world knowledge. It is better suited for improvisation.

It is best played after  \hyperref[ch:the name of the rose]{"The Name of the Rose"} in \hyperref[subsec:Ravensburg]{Ravensburg}. Maybe the players got a hint to visit Überlingen there but can not travel directly by Zepelin (\hyperref[sec:Jaime and Elisabeth]{Elisabeth}: "last time we were in Überlingen there were some ...misunderstandings and ...complications. But we can bring you to Salem").

\section{Topic}

This adventure around Salem has two different biomes. The burned down city of Salem and the woods between Salem and Überlingen.

\subsection{Salem}

Since 2035 Salem is a burned down ruin.
The rich Billionairs who fled to the moon used Salem as a training ground for their kids and potential servants. After training was finished they destroyed the evidence by blowing up the whole city.

\begin{itemize}
    \item The insane mindset of the Billionairs seeing people just as tools for their goals
    \item An institution turned bad
    \item
    \item
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Wood}

10 years ago they came from the remote area of the Deggenhauser Tal: Some Lost ignored the burned down Salem and moved directly to the woods as settlers. They are building a spread out settlement there (despite the monkeys) and start an economy. The player characters are asked to carry the different products to the others and in this way play the logistics role of the walkers in the Settlers Computer game.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Logistics for a small settlement
    \item Simple and with no big goal has its own benefits. It is somehow idyllic
    \item Despite the monkey threat everything here feels welcoming and positive
    \item All the Eiseles are nice people and have plenty of good food for the visitors
\end{itemize}

\section{Summary}

In both Biomes wild monkeys, escaped from the animal park "Affenberg Salem" are a threat. The wild monkeys must be repelled or fought. They are very fast and can climb. So beware. To scare the monkeys away a dead monkey nailed to a wall or post can be used. This leads to the necessity to hunt one and always carry it around....

The city is burned down after the Billionairs blew it up. But as they were using extra explosives at the crime scenes - and trying to trigger it blew the fuses - the evidence can still be found. If you want to search close to the stacks of C4 and fertilizer. The two locations are the sports centre (where there is a centrifuge for astronaut training and a pool to train zero gravity EVA). And the centre of the school, the old School/Abbey where you can find lots of documents.

Leaving the town to the south they will soon become a part of a small economy meeting lots of Lost Settlers all with the family name "Eisele" (common for this area) - and they claim not to be relatives.
They will need some help distributing their goods and also their carrier pigeons.

Currently the famous \hyperref[sec:Gene Dealer]{Gene Dealer} is active in this area.

\section{Getting started}

\section{Salem}

Salem was blown up. To hide evidence. Ruins are still left. Outside of Salem the people were busy fighting different disasters so after an initial scan the official explanation was "gas leak".

\subsection{Fritz Eisele}
The only inhabitant is "Fritz Eisele" who may be the first of the Eiseles the characters meet. He is a fisher with a small hut build out of rubble close to the lake in Salem.
He is protecting himself with a monkey nailed to the fence. As the monkey is already rotting he will ask the characters to provide a fresh one and pays with guns and smoked fish.
Asked he will tell more about the monkey-threat and why he keeps a dead monkey around.

He can also tell more about the other Eiseles in the wood and will need support distributing fish and his carrier pigeons to the other Eiseles (the birds are the way they communicate).

\subsection{Sports center}

The whole sports center is filled with stacked C4 explosives and fertilizers. The only reason this did not blow up when the bad guys left: The fuse blew. I do not advice to fix the electricity.


\subsection{School}

The school was once very famous, had a high quality and the boarding school set in historical buildings was impressive. Early in their plans the Billionairs started a hostile takeover (starting 2027). Replaced management and soon everyone not fit for their evil plans. The old headmaster committed "suicide" soon after that.
Secretly they changed the whole curriculum to space. Teaching technology, training in the centrifuge and EVAs in pools.
Evidence of that can be found on 200 year old wooden desks and in ledgers in expensive leather.
But to do so you first have to enter the old school building (the monkeys on the roof defending their territory by throwing feces and dead birds at the visitors). And after they enter the building challenging them with a high speed fight in a dark 3D environment of the marble staircase. And unexploded C4 everywhere.

The whole school building is filled with stacked C4 explosives and fertilizers. The only reason this did not blow up when the bad guys left: The fuse blew. I do not advice to fix the electricity.

You can also find the bodies of the staff shot 2035 to hide evidence. The murderers expected to hide the crime by blowing up the building.

If the investigation turns up all the documents the protagonists will learn that there were three groups of kids in the astronaut training:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The rich kids. Their destiny: rules in space
    \item The average kids whose body tolerated the brain implant: Their destiny is slaves in space.
    \item the average kids without the implant: Killed 2035 when everyone left to the space center for the rocket launch
\end{itemize}

\section{Woods}

The woods are between Salem in the north and Überlingen in the south. Plants have reclaimed the area.

\subsection{Restaurant "Goldener Anker"}

The Golden anchor is a renovated and active restaurant next to the destroyed road between Salem and Überlingen. It is run by "Herr und Frau Eisele" who call each other that way as well. Not using their first name. Despite being low tech they managed to get it idyllic and cosy. Both are cooking, gardening and repairing.
Around this restaurant there is enough of a small farm to sustain them and any visitor:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Rabbit hutches
    \item Chicken coops
    \item Beehives
    \item Biodiverse gardens (8 different potato varieties, several apple varieties, herbs...)
    \item Distillery
    \item A bakehouse
    \item Simple and with no big goal has its own benefits. It is somehow idyllic
\end{itemize}

They currently prefer books as payment. Shocking every Lost: They use the pages to fold small bags for the seed they harvest.

They will pay with shelter, excellent food and Frau Eiseles famous scratchy knitted jumpers.

A guest in their restaurant is the \hyperref[sec:Gene Dealer]{Gene Dealer}

\subsection{The Goat Eisele}

About a 1-2 hours walking trip away from the Restaurant the so called Goat Eisele has his shepherd's cart at a pasture. There he is living a happy life together with his sheep and goats.
He is not intelligent, not educated and can not read. But he can handle living out there pretty well. He knows all about sheep, weather, cheese, milk, herbs and his shepherd dogs.
As he can not read communication with the pigeons is limited to drawings.
Normally the Eiseles at the Restaurant want some flesh and cheesse (with and without herbs). And send bread instead. Transportation is of course done by the protagonists in exchange for food and shelter.

Several times a year he is shearing wool. He spins it into threads, dyes them and sends it to the Restaurant where Frau Eisele is crafting here famous scratchy knitted jumpers.

\subsection{Pia Eisele}

Pia Eisele lives at the other side of the Restaurant. Also about 1-2 hours away. At a hill side she raised several tents. But lives in a cave together with her mushroom farm. She is growing about a dozen different edible mushrooms in the wood and in the tunnels.
Those tunnels were naturally cooled beer storage from about 1800.

If you wonder if the Eiseles reproduce or a inbreed:
Pia Eisele is a cheerful woman and has 5 kids. Those kids of different ages and very obvious from different fathers (all travelers who happened to visit Pia once) care for themselves. They are very competent in the woods and can hunt their own monkeys with their bows.

They grow up happy but definitely not according to any pedagogical standards. If you want to label it, it is a kind of anti-authoritarian forest kindergarten. If your benchmark is survival capability: The education is a full success.

Interacting with the kids: They are curious and want to learn to write or read their names.

Everyone here is wearing the warm and scratchy knitted jumpers from Frau Eisele.

If there are good looking men in the protagonist group: This is the opportunity to become father without any responsibility attached. Test playing this was a fun moment of ethical discussions in my group.

Pia will pay for logistics or some education session for the kids in mushrooms. Those are also the goods they want transported to the Restaurant for the famous Mushroom Goulash of Frau Eisele.

Of course: She is also short on pigeons.


\section{Deggenhauser Tal}

Not part of the area or the adventure. But all the Eiseles come from there. So here is some background.

Between Ravensburg and Salem is the valley "Deggenhause Tal". Even 2020 this valley is remote. Simple to reach but all main roads somehow avoid it and no one visits by accident. Some hills and rivers also make visiting a bit harder. Not impossible. But inconvenient. This caused a special mindset and made people like the Eiseles self sufficient an independent.
