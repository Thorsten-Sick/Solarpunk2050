\chapter{Start Playing}

You have just learned the basics and the factions. This book is a tutorial. You should start playing now.

Decide who will be the GM, have them jump to the first adventure. All the information you need is either in the adventure or linked from there.

The quests come with ready-made characters, and the first ones focus on small parts of the world. A manageable part of the whole sandbox.
Specific themes in the adventure are linked to the detailed description in the Sourcebook. The GM can prepare as much as she likes.

This is the way the book is meant to be used.

\section{Adventures}

The first set of adventures takes place in southern Germany, on the shores of Lake Constance. In 2023, this region is rural, with small towns and high-tech industry. A good basis for all the factions to start rebuilding after the disasters.
