\chapter{Start Playing}

You know the basics and the factions. If you should start playing now. Decide who will be GM, let her jump to the first adventure.
All information you need is either in the adventure or linked from there.

The adventures are used as a tutorial to learn the world. They come with pre-fab characters and the first ones just focus on small parts of the world. A manageable compartment in the whole sandbox.
Specific topics in the adventure are linked to the detailed description in the sourcebook. So the GM can prepare as deep as she wants.

This is the way this book is meant to be used.
