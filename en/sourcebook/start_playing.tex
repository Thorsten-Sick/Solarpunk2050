\chapter{Start Playing}

You have just learned the basics and the factions. This book is designed as a tutorial. And you should start playing now.

Decide who will be the GM, let them jump to the first adventure. All the information you need is either in the adventure or linked from there.

The quests come with ready-made characters and the first ones only focus on small parts of the world. A manageable part of the whole sandbox.
Specific themes in the adventure are linked to the detailed description in the sourcebook. The GM can prepare as much as she wants.

This is the way the book is meant to be used.

\section{Adventures}

The first batch of the adventures is set in southern Germany, at the Lake of Constance. 2023 this region is rural with small towns and high tech industry. A good foundation for all the factions to start rebuilding after the disasters.
