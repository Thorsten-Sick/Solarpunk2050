\chapter{Start Playing}

You just learned the basics and the factions. This book is built as a tutorial. And you can start playing now.

Decide who will be GM, let her jump to the first adventure. All information you need is either in the adventure or linked from there.

The adventures come with pre-fab characters and the first ones just focus on small parts of the world. A manageable compartment in the whole sandbox.
Specific topics in the adventure are linked to the detailed description in the sourcebook. The GM can prepare as deep as she wants.

This is the way this book is meant to be used.
