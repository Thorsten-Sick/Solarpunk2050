\section{Lost}

The Lost are the faction that did not join the others on the "Dirty road to Eden". They quite early realized that some horrors will be involved in achieving a Solarpunk utopia. And they did not want to pay the price. This faction is the only one not actively denying what happened.

Their approach is to live in and from the ruins of the Lemmings civilisation. They reuse, recycle and upcycle the old technology. This is what their cloths, tools, vehicles and housings are made of. Old tech reused in a creative way. Most of it looks shaggy.

Living in the ruins they developed combat and survival skills and are experts in exploration.
Many historians are in their ranks collecting old documents for their secret "Alexandria" project.

Daily life: Lost constantly fight for survival. Either by gathering food in the wilderness, the ruins or by fixing old technology. Some tend to farms. Others run stores or try to keep truck stops alive to allow some kind of safe travel through the wilderness. Their internal trade system is a \hyperref[sec:Barter]{Barter} so they trade and item for other items, food, information or diesel.
The Lost receive Resource Points like everyone else. But they tend to spend it on the privilege to burn diesel. This is why they are forced to search for resource in ruins to upcycle or recycle (for Resource Points).

By depending on old technology they are the only faction without drones. But they are also the only faction with trained animals.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Dogs for searching, rescue, hunting and dragging carts
    \item Horses for riding and transportation
    \item Rats for sniffing for substances, testing food and rescue operations
    \item Birds (eagles, falcons, owls for hunting or scouting
    \item Dolphins and seals.
\end{itemize}

Some of the Lost almost developed a mystical bond to their animals. At leasta ccording to their Norm friends who grew up in towns.

The Lost do not necessarily trust the Pioneers or the Norms. Because they still remember the "Dirty Road to Eden" pretty well.
