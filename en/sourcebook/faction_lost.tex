\section{Lost}

The Lost are the faction that did not join the others on the "Dirty Road to Eden". They realised early on that some horrors will be involved in achieving a Solarpunk utopia. And they did not want to pay the price. This faction is the only one not actively denying what happened.

Their approach is to live in and from the ruins of the Lemmings civilisation. They reuse, recycle and upcycle the old technology. This is what their cloths, tools, vehicles and housings are made of. Old tech reused in a creative way. Most of it looks shaggy.

Living in the ruins they developed combat and survival skills and are experts in exploration.
Many historians are in their ranks collecting old documents for their secret "Alexandria" project.

Daily life: Lost constantly fight for survival. Either by gathering food in the wilderness, the ruins or by fixing old technology. Some tend to farms. Others run stores or try to keep truck stops alive to allow some kind of safe travel through the wilderness. Their internal trade system is a \hyperref[sec:Barter]{Barter} so they trade and item for other items, food, information or diesel.
The Lost receive Resource Points like everyone else. But they tend to spend it on the privilege to burn diesel. This is why they are forced to search for resource in ruins to upcycle or recycle (for Resource Points).

By depending on old technology they are the only faction without drones. But they are also the only faction with trained animals.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Dogs for searching, rescue, hunting and dragging carts
    \item Horses for riding and transportation
    \item Rats for sniffing for substances, testing food and rescue operations
    \item Birds (eagles, falcons, owls for hunting or scouting
    \item Dolphins and seals.
\end{itemize}

Some of the Lost almost developed a mystical bond to their animals. At leasta ccording to their Norm friends who grew up in towns.

The Lost do not necessarily trust the Pioneers or the Norms. Because they still remember the "Dirty Road to Eden" pretty well.

\subsection{Traditions}

\subsubsection{Guests and weapons}

As survival experts helping people and giving shelter is a sacred tradition. People who come in good faith receive shelter, food, medical care (Lost medicine is mostly rustical first aid).

But before entering a Lost camp guests are searched for weapons. If they do not have any they receive simple to use ones for the time of their visit. They can also get basic weapons training. Lost expect guests help defend their camp when it is attacked by critters or other people. This is why guests are armed.

If the guests are not trustworthy, they do not receive the ammo for their weapon - until their help in defending the camp is needed.

\subsubsection{Libraries}

The first impression other factions have when first meeting the Lost is a uneducated bunch of survival specialists and fighters. As soon as they start to know some Lost they will learn about their true mission: protecting the past. They collect old books (from phone books to the Luther bible) and Art (also: every day objects to old paintings).
those are kept in the mobile Library most Lost families carry with them (a steel box in the trunk or a special armored bus).

Books that are not yet in Alexandria are sent there on a pilgrimage. This is a paper chase adventure with missions at every post. The official goal of that is a spritual experience and growth that can lead to some of the participiants becoming Librarians of Alexandria. The inofficial goal is to hide the current location of Alexandria from anyone trailing this group.
Secretly groups travelling to Alexandria are watched by experienced Librarians. Anyone following those groups will be dealt with.

Most of the year the Librarians life together with a family during the year. Only when Alexandria forms, they are called and leave the family for some months.

Alexandria is a Library built out of shipping containers. To protect it it only exists for a few weeks per year. The locations is a secret and only Librarians know it. Pilgrims are directed there by the paper chase. The containers hold the books and the index of the library.

As soon as a group of pilgrims arrive they hand over the book, which will be indexed. Experienced forgers will created exact duplicates which are sealed with the seal of the Library and handed back to the pilgrims. Each pilgrim can also pick a book from the Library. A copy of this is mass produced (using an old printing press) and will be sent back with the pilgrims to their families library.
This way knowledge is spread and a de-centralized backup is established.

All Lost know about the Library. But only a few outsiders - those who safed the life of a Lost and found a book that is not in Alexandria yet are asked to join a group of Pilgrims under a vow of secrecy.

\subsubsection{Librarians}

A pilgrim can request to become a Librarian. Besides being able to quote 50 books a Librarian has to show special skills the Library needs. This can range from forger, fighter (to protect the library), treasure hunter, builder (to re-build the Library once a year) to cook (to support the pilgrim's gathering).
Part of the initiation rite is tattoing as much text as possible from the new Librarians favourite book onto his or her body. People who know (this is mostly Lost) can recognized a Librarians by the tattooed letters.
Skin that can not be hidden is kept free of text.
