\section{Lost}

The Lost are the faction that did not join the others on the "Dirty road to Eden". They quite early realized that some horrors will be involved in achieving a Solarpunk utopia. And they did not want to pay the price. This faction is the only one not actively denying what happened.

Their approach is to life in and from the ruins of the Lemmings civilsation. The reuse the old technology and enhance it. This is what their cloths, tools, vehicles and housings are made of. Old tech reused in a creative way.

Living in the ruins they developed combat and survival skills and are experts in exploration.
Many historians are in their ranks.

They do not necessarily trust the Pioneers or the Norms. Because they still remember the "Dirty Road to Eden" pretty well.
