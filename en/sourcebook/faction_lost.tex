\section{Lost}

The Lost are the faction that did not join the others on the "Dirty road to Eden". They quite early realized that some horrors will be involved in achieving a Solarpunk utopia. And they did not want to pay the price. This faction is the only one not actively denying what happened.

Their approach is to live in and from the ruins of the Lemmings civilisation. They reuse, recycle and upcycle the old technology. This is what their cloths, tools, vehicles and housings are made of. Old tech reused in a creative way. Most of it looks shaggy.

Living in the ruins they developed combat and survival skills and are experts in exploration.
Many historians are in their ranks collecting old documents for their secret "Alexandria" project.

By depending on old technology they are the only faction without drones. But they are also the only faction with trained animals.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Dogs for searching, rescue, hunting and dragging carts
    \item Horses for riding and transportation
    \item Rats for sniffing for substances, testing food and rescue operations
\end{itemize}
Some of the Lost almost developed a mystical bond to their animals.

The Lost do not necessarily trust the Pioneers or the Norms. Because they still remember the "Dirty Road to Eden" pretty well.
