\chapter{Locations}

Large parts of the world have been destroyed or damaged by climate catastrophes. But small bubbles, towns and settlements fought back and found their own way to survive.

\subsection{Altshausen}

In 2020, Altshausen has hot springs on a hill above the old town. Due to heavy fighting in the area, the springs have been unleashed and the hot mineral water has been flowing downhill ever since. The new inhabitants - mostly Lost - use it to their advantage.
They channel it into pools and gardens. Their greenhouses grow winter and summer vegetables.
All this is relatively low-tech, but some Pioneers are helping them keep the water flowing. For the look: Mix a medieval town with Venice and Pamukkale. Add some greenhouses and small onsen pools.


\subsection{Weingarten}

At first glance, Weingarten is a lost city. It is stuck in the 1980s and can be visited. In reality, the few hundred inhabitants live in a kind of re-enactment slash theme park. It is not self-sustaining (which is why any Lost would hate to be associated with Weingarten).
It can only survive by trading with every visitor, trying to extract as much food, money, resource points and help as possible from everyone who stays there. In return, they offer an authentic 80s feeling...
As the neighbouring town of Ravensburg is fighting against electrosmog at night, there is a large fence between the towns to "protect" Ravensburg from electromagnetic waves.
Some people from Ravensburg like to spend the night in Weingarten - at least Weingarten has electricity at night.


\subsection{Ravensburg}

Ravensburg is a Norm hive.
In the early 2020s, fears of electrosmog led the city to turn off the free wifi at night. This only got worse over the years. In 2050, Ravensburg switches off all electricity at night.

Situated on the river "Schussen", Ravensburg has built a park on the banks. To give people shelter during the summer heat waves. There are trees, water gardens and water playgrounds. Perfect for spending a hot day with the family.

On the sports side: Ravensburg is famous for its parkour team and the tracks across the medieval roofs.

\subsection{Meckenbeuren}

Meckenbeuren lies between Ravensburg and Friedrichshafen. The trains never stop at Meckenbeuren. Instead, protective armour plates are lowered over the windows and the train speeds up. As the train passes through Meckenbeuren, gunshots can be heard.

It is a mixture of Escape from New York and a rural farm town. And it is very likely that sooner or later someone will have to be rescued.

\subsection{Friedrichshafen}

Friedrichshafen is located on Lake Constance. This Norm town is famous for its hobby group of historical pilots and dogfighters.

There are two leagues: The VR League, where pilots fly simulated aircraft. And the real league, where pilots fly WW2 planes like the Spitfire.

The planes have electric motors and an autopilot that flies them to the 'graveyard airport' as soon as the plane registers a simulated hit.
The pilot can choose to parachute out of the plane to skip the respawn (which is expensive in terms of league points), or stay in the automated plane and fly back to the graveyard.

Lost shudder at the lack of historical accuracy. All teams can fly all types of aircraft. Plus: the bad guy team is based on Nazi zombie B-movies and dressed like them.

But this city is a valid source of characters with special flying skills.

\subsection{Waterworld}

A floating Pioneer city somewhere on Lake Constance. The different rafts are used to grow plants, sleep, build new things, generate electricity or clean water. Transport is provided by various water vehicles.
