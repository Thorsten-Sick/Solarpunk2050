Story nuggets are NPCs, events and locations you can use in any story. In some cases I will add examples how I integrated them into my adventures. But you are free to change that and insert them any way you want.

\section{Jaime und Elisabeth von Walther, Zeppelin for hire}
\label{sec:Jaime and Elisabeth}

Jaime and Elisabeth von Walther are enthusiastic Zeppelin pilots. And very hospitable.
The Norms work as pilots of a 10-passenger Zeppelin, which is very comfortably equipped inside. It can carry some load in addition to the passengers.
The interior can be quickly rearranged by them (rows of seats, lounge, cinema, luxury bed, ...) and is their home.
Both take turns in the jobs of pilot and steward. Since they both have the same clothing size, they make a joke out of simply swapping clothes and roles in the cockpit between jobs. So each wears the miniskirt at times.
They are quite open as a couple. In the marriage agreement it says:
"Each may go to bed with strangers. But must ask the partner if he/she wants to join in".

These two are a convenient and comfortable shuttle "into action" with possible personal entanglements should they fall for a character or NPC.

They used to work at Dumpit/Cargo (See Albstadt Adventures). When that was closed down by the UN, they cleverly got out. They took the opportunity to buy the little Zeppelin.
