\chapter{Story nuggets}

Story nuggets are NPCs, events and locations you can use in any story. In some cases I will add examples how I integrated them into my adventures. But you are free to change that and insert them any way you want.

\section{Jaime and Elisabeth von Walther}
\label{sec:Jaime and Elisabeth}

Jaime and Elisabeth von Walther, Zeppelin for hire

Jaime and Elisabeth von Walther are enthusiastic Zeppelin pilots. And very hospitable.
The Norms work as pilots of a 10-passenger Zeppelin, which is very comfortably equipped inside. It can carry some load in addition to the passengers.
The interior can be quickly rearranged by them (rows of seats, lounge, cinema, luxury bed, ...) and is their home.
Both take turns in the jobs of pilot and steward. Since they both have the same clothing size, they make a joke out of simply swapping clothes and roles in the cockpit between jobs. So each wears the miniskirt at times.
They are quite open as a couple. In the marriage agreement it says:
"Each may go to bed with strangers. But must ask the partner if he/she wants to join in".

These two are a convenient and comfortable shuttle "into action" with possible personal entanglements should they fall for a character or NPC.

They used to work at Dumpit/Cargo (See Albstadt Adventures). When that was closed down by the UN, they cleverly got out. They took the opportunity to buy the little Zeppelin.

\section{Gene Dealer}
\label{sec:Gene Dealer}

The Gene Dealer has set himself the goal of collecting and preserving the genes of as many plant and animal species as possible.
For this reason he is travelling the world.
He doesn't really belong to any of the three factions, but is very welcome everywhere he is known.

Today he is 70 years old and has a scarred face and very poor sleep. And wakes up with nightmares.
Because of his age, the Gene Dealer often has helpers - especially in rough terrain. Their job is to collect samples and seed of plants.

Before the disaster, the Gene Dealer used to discuss the economy and share prices on television. When the climate catastrophe had long been on the horizon. The recommendations to invest in fossil fuels - and thus contribute to the catastrophe - still deprive him of sleep today. In his delusion, he later destroyed his face so as not to be recognised.
Genes are collected as gene scans using portable recorders or simply as seeds. Both are readily exchanged.
