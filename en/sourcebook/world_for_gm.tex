\chapter{World for the GM}

Many events lead to the world of 2050. And they can all be the source of story arcs. The people of 2050 are only aware of some rumours. But the real events are much more drastic and have a strong impact on 2050.

\label{sec:Billionaires from outer space}

The world of 2050 is post-capitalist. This is because the billionaires have secretly left the Earth. These are the events leading to the exodus:

\subsection{When money does not help, more money helps}

Billionaires are used to being insulated from the consequences of their actions. With their money, they can buy all the lawyers, managers and scientists they want. And that is why they have botched their money-driven approach to saving the planet. Instead of really understanding science, ecosystems or society, they just took a stupid idea and force multiplied it with their money.

The fallout like giant mutant monster hamsters still exist in 2050. As well as some relic companies that are still going down the road to chaos.

\subsubsection{Eat the rich festivals}

Having failed, the billionaires tried something new and threw a lot of money at it. Science festivals. Basically music festivals where they celebrated themselves and each other and tried to win followers. These followers had the chance of a lifetime to get a brain implant.
Those who got the implant became true believers in capitalism and followed their new leaders. The implant triggers a serotonin cascade when certain trigger words like "line goes up", "investment" or "shareholder value" are mentioned.

Each billionaire was given a single chance to convince people to follow him. This was the last time that billionaire was seen in public.

What really happened: The billionaire left Earth for his secret base on the far side of the moon, taking some followers with him and leaving some as sleepers on Earth. Some of them watched over their underground lair, filled with technology and tools for their master's return.

The last billionaire to cross the orbit triggered the Kessler Syndrome, making it impossible for anyone to follow.

After a year, all the Billionaires left Earth. People began to wonder what had happened to them. The joke was that all the Billionaires were eaten at these festivals. The term "Eat the Rich Festivals" was coined. In case of an outbreak, the health authorities would freeze small portions of food. These were taken out of the freezer and analysed. The results were never published. Because they found: All the meat served at these festivals as doner kebabs, sausages and the like contained human DNA. Specifically: That of the billionaires.

The truth: These festivals were organised in the early days of lab meat. Some of the billionaires thought it was a joke to clone their own cells into meat and serve it there. They expected chaos when people found out. Animal-based lab meat will become a thing about 2 years later. And nobody thought about the possibility.

\subsubsection{Using this story arc}

The three factions have different approaches to the economy. But hardcore capitalism is not one of them. If you want to explore alternatives to capitalism, get the players used to the different economic approaches. Then add some people who want to turn back the clock to capitalism, while sending the protagonists on quests where they slowly uncover the secret of the billionaire base on the moon.
Maybe this is a secret better shared only with people who can handle it. Or should everything be public?

\begin{itemize}
    \item If anyone were to get the DNA data from the hidden lab, it would cause a scandal.
    \item Reading the full report would create even more mystery: The lab estimates that about 500kg of each billionaire was eaten - impossible!
    \item The real event of billionaires leaving Earth would be a world-shattering one.
    \item The billionaires will continue to pamper their relic companies and try to rebuild capitalism using their underground storehouses and sleeper agents.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Inspiration}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Iron Sky
    \item Billionaires plan cage match
    \item Glass Onion
    \item Billionaires build submarines and think the laws of physics do not apply to them
\end{itemize}
