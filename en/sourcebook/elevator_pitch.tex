Solarpunk 2050: A FATE Setting - It's the year 2050. The climate change has killed millions and destroyed society as we know it. But the Solarpunks have saved humanity. And although now everything could be fine now . . . it is not.

What used to be the Solarpunk movement is fractured.

The \textbf{Pioneers} live their hyper-progressive individualistic technological utopia while the \textbf{Norms} live in hive cities in an AI controlled environment as a collective society. And the \textbf{Lost} have decided that humanity should never have become so dependent on the latest technology.

In this game, players can play characters from any of these factions and work together to build a new utopia - which would be easy if they could agree on one.
