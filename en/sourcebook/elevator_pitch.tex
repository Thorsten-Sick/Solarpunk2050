Solarpunk 2050: A FATE setting - It's 2050. Global warming has
killed millions and destroyed society as we know it. But mankind safed itself. Solarpunks saved humanity. And even though everything could be all right now
be fine now ... it is not.

What will once be the Solarpunk movement is still fractured.

The \textbf{Pioneers} live in their hyper-progressive individualistic technological
utopia, while the  \textbf{Norms} live in hive cities in an AI-controlled environment as a collective society.
as a collective society. And the \textbf{Lost} are of the opinion that humanity should never have been so dependent on the latest technology.

In this game, players will be able to play as a character from one of these factions and
and work together towards the creation of a new utopia - which would be easy if they could be on the same page.
