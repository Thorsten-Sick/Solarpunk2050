Solarpunk 2050: A FATE Setting - It's the year 2050. The Solarpunks have saved humanity. And although now everything could be fine . . . it is not.

The Pioneers live their hyper-progressive technology utopia while the normal people think that we have already achieved enough by saving the world and that we can finally finish watching the latest series - the AI has marked it as a personal recommendation. And the Lost want to go back to the 1990's as it never was. With added violence.

The work of the Pioneers is not finished yet. And they are happy about that.

\begin{pioneertalk}[title=Pioneer Photovoltaik site]
    Well folks. Unpack the soldering irons. We need a new autonomous solar farm for community expansion.
    We have 10 laser welding machines. Fits perfectly - there's no dispute this time - all the children can help stand up the solar modules. Who is securing the perimeter with the drones this today? Yesterday someone heard diesel engines in the forest.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \npcquote{Drone Pilot}{Folks, I don't see any casualties, but we have a problem}
        \item \npcquote{Benjamin}{Are the children okay?}
        \item \npcquote{Drone Pilot}{Yes. No one was hurt. 10 with laser welding devices, 5 with their child-sized exoskeletons constructing the solar modules. But they 're doing too well.}
        \item \npcquote{Benjamin}{?}
        \item \npcquote{Drone Pilot}{From above, the modules look like a giant penis. Time to penis of 5 hours is impressive perfomance. But I'm for house arrest}
        \item \npcquote{Benjamin}{I wouldn't give one for that. When I was young I went through a phase where I drew stuff on bus stops with permanent markers}
        \item \npcquote{Drone pilot}{But you can see him from space !!!}
        \item \npcquote{Drone Pilot}{. . . Tonight at the community meeting. We need to talk. . .}
    \end{itemize}

\begin{normtalk}[title=Party chat]
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \npcquote{Tscharlien}{Found something in an underground forum. For the episode 5 season 6 of Woodland Village you should buy the Mykonos inc red wine, the Mykonos inc olives (black) and the Mykonos inc feta. Why it didn't say.}
        \item \npcquote{Mischell}{I read that too. Unfortunately did not do that.}
        \item \npcquote{Kewin}{I saw that too. Why should I have done that ? Missed the episode.}
        \item \npcquote{Tscharlien}{That was so awesome!!! It was so great! The gang in the episode sat there at the table in this fine pub between 1:45 and 2:15 and ate exactly the same things! I felt like I was there!}
        \item \npcquote{Mischell}{I saw that too. Will always regret not belonging to the underground forums inner circle.}
        \item \npcquote{Marwin}{You are aware that this was a marketing stunt ?}
        \item \npcquote{Mischell}{Do not spoil the fun. I know. I even know the team who did that. They promised to weave the series into reality even more. "At a level no one will expect to be possible".}
        \item \npcquote{Tscharlien}{This is art. Like the Banksy monument in Moskow}
        \item \npcquote{Mischell}{...or the solarpunkified pyramids in Egypt}
        \item \npcquote{Marwin}{But that made a lot of people angry}
        \item \npcquote{Mischell}{The only angry people were Lemmings. The locals liked that it respected the traditions and the ancient Egyptians who built the pyramids would have loved it}
    \end{itemize}

\begin{losttalk}[title=Council of war]
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \npcquote{Brutus}{According to our scouts, the Pioneers are celebrating their new crazy thing: a giant Solar Penis. While the weirdos are distracted, we'll raid the Norm City}
        \item \npcquote{Achilles}{A what ?}
        \item \npcquote{Brutus}{The Plan: Motorbike Phalanx to the marketplace. Artillery at the city limits. Flanking from Greengate Park and from the ice cream parlour.}
        \item \npcquote{Achilles}{By the way, the can artillery people are sober again}
        \item \npcquote{Brutus}{Good}
        \item \npcquote{Brutus}{Then we'll get the most important BBDs out with the trucks and be gone within an hour. By then the police will arrive from the next town or so.}
        \item \npcquote{Achilles}{How much beer, beans and diesel can we get in the truck in an hour?}
        \item \npcquote{Brutus}{...is 5 years in a row already a tradition ?}       
    \end{itemize}
    The conversation is interrupted by a test shot from the can artillery hitting the tent. No injuries

\begin{normtalk}[title=Defenses]
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \npcquote{Supervisor}{Chief Inspector Dehnis? The Lost are attacking the city. Your troops have order to retreat so as to not to further provoke the Lost}
        \item \npcquote{Chief Inspector Dehnis}{Understood}
        \item \npcquote{Supervisor}{Are the warehouses sufficiently stocked with diesel, beer and beans?}
        \item \npcquote{Chief Inspector Dehnis}{Yes}
        \item \npcquote{Supervisor}{Well, then it should be over soon. By the way, reinforcements are on the way. Meets in 1-2 hours}
        \item \npcquote{Supervisor}{And make sure the Pioneers don't interfere. If necessary, encircle and seal them off. They will try to save the city again. I don't want to have to work overtime today.}        
        \item \npcquote{Chief Inspector Dehnis}{...is 5 years in a row already a tradition ?}
    \end{itemize}
\end{normtalk}


\begin{pioneertalk}[title=Gathering]
    \begin{itemize}        
        \item \npcquote{Bernd}{Guys, short party break. The city is attacked by the Lost. We'll have to save it. The police have cordoned off the streets. We race through the forest with the e-bikes.}
        \item \npcquote{Bernd}{The angel system is currently being updated. Everyone who wants to join assigns to one of the five teams. Details are in the angel system.}
        \item \npcquote{Bernd}{The Lost are after BBDs. In addition to protecting people and the city, we ensure that the diesel tanker does not leave the city.}
        \item \npcquote{Bernd}{The tanker must not burn out under any circumstances. The last time we compensated CO2 for 2 years. And that's why Team Five is the Hazmat Team. Only people with the necessary training can register there. This team always stays with the tanker. Don't forget the equipment!}
        \item \npcquote{Bernd}{Well. The task tickets are online. Everyone takes up to three tickets with tactical objectives and let's go.}
        \item \npcquote{Bernd}{The rest keep partying. We'll be back in three hours at most.}        
        \item \npcquote{Bernd}{I'd call 5 years in a row a tradition. Have fun.}
    \end{itemize}
