\section{Pioneers}

The Pioneers have taken the future into their own hands. They saved everyone and the planet and now draw their strength from this.
Hard-core Pioneers make up only a small fraction of the population (and that can vary locally). But since they actively participate in life, they are also the part that leaves their mark on society.

\subsection{Skill: Prototyping}

Pioneer technology is unique. They find smart solutions for problems. They tend to build prototypes that will never be used as mass produced.

Those prototypes are built fast, fix a problem, use available technology and will never get a certificate for safety.
Quite often they are not meant to last.
If a pioneer will have to build the same technology a second time it will be built with additional features or a different approach.

For this kind of dirty engineering, use the skill "Prototyping".

If non-renewable resources are requires also roll for "Resources"
