\section{Profile}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Political System: Ruled by AI
    \item Appearance: off-the-shelf clothes, clothing is not exchanged fast fashion moderately quickly for ecological reasons. But there are many accessories with which one can present one's belonging and fashion knowledge. Often adapted to the current favorite star
    \item Taboos: Not conforming, not familiar with current pop culture
    \item Language: Flowery with many references to series
    \item Tendencies: Conformist. consumers
    \item Corruption: There is still something like that among the last remnants of the factory owners. Otherwise the society is happy.
    \item Weapons: None. Law enforcement officers have them, from tasers to simple firearms. But the crime rate is low. Attacks by the Lost are met with (late arriving) military
    \item Resources: There is a lack of creative and new things. The media industry always tries to use templates creating something new and often fails. On the other hand, it must not be too disruptive either
    \item Celebrations: Big parties and clubs. Pomp. You sometimes start thinking a week in advance about how to wants to be “individual” and stand out. . . .
    \item Drugs: To numb and forget the world. Gladly longer. Sick leave for drugs After effects are normal. Drugs are cheap in stores.
    \item Psychotherapy: Is planned from birth. Therapy places are available. If the AI detects a problem, the seat is assigned. It's not a big deal in society when someone goes into therapy .
    \item Media: Media production and entertainment is central to culture. A lot is consumed and perfection in the quality of the media is immensely important. News and information is there, but simplified enough for a 14 year old to understand.
    \item Education: Norms learn through Apps. Most Apps have a tutorial. There are educational Apps as well.
    \item Names: International fashion names. But rewritten to local syntax. To make it simpler to pronounce them. Tscharlien, Mischelle, Kewin
%    \item Gender: sometimes yes, sometimes no
\end{itemize}

Make up about 80\% of the population. They have done the minimum necessary to adapt to 2050. You live  a life as similar as the one before. However, they also do not benefit greatly from modern technology and society. Often consumers of industrial products. Are CO2 neutral because the structures around them ensure this. But spend disproportionate money by paying the structures for it. Their environment was configured by algorithms (aka AI) and optimized for the highest possible quality of life, which also leads to distortions. They work 25 hours a week (it has been found that this promotes happiness). Career jumps are about every 2 years and you hardly have to do anything for them. there is enough money. TV series are knitted from templates that A/B tests have determined that as many people as possible like them. Advertising steers consumption in the right direction. Life expectancy is about 90 years.



\section{Work and Education}
Labor is highly specialized. Norms learn their job for life and are then cogs in a complex system. Her level in her job is equal to the City Culture skill since the job is basically done in the city using the AI.
\begin{normtalk}[title=An example from the life of a Level 3 Architect.]
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \npcquote{Architect}{(Drags three apartment modules onto the grassy area in AR) Ok, what color should the light switches have?}
        \item \npcquote{Customer}{White}
        \item \npcquote{Architect}{(Changes setting). Finished. The AI checked the construction and calculated the costs. Euro and raw material costs are displayed, please confirm.}
        \item \npcquote{Customer}{(Confirmed)}
        \item \npcquote{Architect}{The AI organizes the construction and the 80 craft companies. The excavators will arrive in 1 hour, followed by the glass fiber reinforced concrete. Completion in 5 days by the carpet fitters and light switch fitters. Housewarming is included and invitations were just sent.}
    \end{itemize}
