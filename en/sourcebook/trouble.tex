\chapter{Trouble}

Humanity has somehow managed the climate disasters and created bubbles with different approaches to a more sustainable society. Most of the time life is great. But there are threats from inside or outside that can cause problems.

\section{Wolf packs}

To combat the large and aggressive groups of wild boar, wolves were genetically modified to reduce their numbers. Of course, this was the idea of billionaires trying to throw money and biotechnology at a problem without understanding the ecology.

The metabolically enhanced wolves are fierce and few victims survive an attack. The downside is that they age at least twice as fast as normal animals (better data is needed, the UN is funding research).

Some crazy and half-crazy survivors claim that these packs use squirrels as spotters. But since any kind of symbiosis between these species is not reasonable, it is assumed that the shock of encountering the beasts caused this hallucination.
