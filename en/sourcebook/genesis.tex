\chapter{Genesis}

It's the year 2050. The last few decades have been a wild ride. Especially after people realized that they have to manage several catastrophes in parallel and that the simplest solution is to rebuild society as a whole, it was: Do or die trying.

They did it, they survived. Most of them.

Thanks in particular to the Solarpunk Communities. Pioneers are people who have started a revolution with extreme out-of-the-box thinking and technological/ecological awareness. In their communities - almost self-contained experimental laboratories - they were experimenters and guinea pigs at the same time. And the general public called Norms watched curiously, fascinated and hoping. They integrated the most successful approaches into their own life and upgraded their cities to match the new reality.
As a result, society in 2050 at large is CO2 neutral, fairer, more peaceful and more open.
The Pioneers saved the world - and yet they can't stop being the incubator for epochal upheavals and mistakes.
The Norms benefited. The Pioneers are still running after reaching the goal. And a third faction got lost on the road to transition - the so called "Dirty road to Eden". The Lost saw the price that will have to be paid and did to aggree with it on a moral level. Instead of pushing for a new future they oriented towards a past. Or a mix of the old epochs of humanity. They life in the ruins caused by catastrophes and the transition. They are gathering, recycling and reusing old tech, are survival experts, fighters and historians.
While the Pioneers and the Norms prefered to forget the recent history, the years they all used to shape the future. Because some things are better forgotten.
