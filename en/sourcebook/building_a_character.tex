\chapter{Building a character}

This source book is based on FATE Condensed (https://fate-srd.com/fate-condensed). It offers simple rules but still the option to play a complex campaign.

For fast fun you can simplify by using FATE Accelerated.
Or add more rules from FATE Core and the extensions.

To build a character using the Condensed rules:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Pick a faction
    \item Pick a profession or specialisation
    \item Get inspired by the philosophies
    \item Now start adding the Aspects
\end{enumerate}

To add more depth: Most of the people alive in 2050 started as a Lemming. Some shock made them pick a new, more sustainable, philosophy. Either Norm, Lost or Pioneer.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item What was your life as Lemming ?
    \item Did you do anything you now regret ?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item A bureaucrat slowing down progress ?
        \item A police officer beating down the first buds of the Solarpunk revolution you are now part of
        \item A politician taking bribes to keep old and unsustainable businesses alive 
    \end{enumerate}
    \item What happened to make you change your mind ?
    \item Do you keep your past life a secret ?
    \item Do you accept what you did ?
    \item Do you try to fix the damage your old self caused ?
\end{enumerate}
