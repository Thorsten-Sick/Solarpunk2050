\chapter{Building a character}

This source book is based on FATE Condensed (https://fate-srd.com/fate-condensed). It offers simple rules but still the option to play a complex campaign.

For fast fun you can simplify by using FATE Accelerated.
Or add more rules from FATE Core and the extensions.

To build a character using the Condensed rules:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Pick a fraction
    \item Pick a profession or specialisation
    \item Get inspired by the philosophies
    \item Now start adding the Aspects
\end{enumerate}
