\chapter{Character creation}

This sourcebook is based on FATE Condensed (https://fate-srd.com/fate-condensed). It offers simple rules but still allows you to play a complex campaign.

For fast fun, you can simplify by using FATE Accelerated.
Or add more rules from FATE Core and Extensions.

Create a character using the Condensed rules:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Pick a faction
    \item Pick a profession or specialisation
    \item Get inspired by the philosophies
    \item Now start adding the Aspects
\end{enumerate}

\section{Special rules}

\subsection{New skills}

Each faction has access to one unique skill. At character creation, you can choose this skill just like any other skill.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \hyperref[sec:Lost]{Lost} are skilled at survival which is covered by their skill \hyperref[sec:Bushcraft skill]{Bushcraft}
    \item \hyperref[sec:Norms]{Norms} have years of experience using their Hive controller which is represented by the \hyperref[sec:Hive control skill]{Hive control} skill
    \item \hyperref[sec:Pioneers]{Pioneers} are masters at improvising technology by using their \hyperref[sec:Prototyping skill]{Prototyping} skill
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Supporting stunts}

Fate contains several stunt templates. At the heart of Solarpunk is the concept of building communities and supporting each other. This is why there is another stunt template:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Because I am a gun nerd, I can provide a +2 to someone's shooting if I have the opportunity to give some advice (example: "This is one of those gun models you should hold with both hands").
    \item Because I am socialising while cooking, I can create a +2 to the social skills of one of the people involved in the cooking (example: cooking with two hostile parties who are trying to make peace).
    \item Because I am a role model in athletics, I can give +2 in athletics to someone who follows my example (example: the person who climbs the rope second).
\end{itemize}

These +2 bonuses are limited to one skill or use case. And they always support someone else.

% Original: Because I am a Smooth Talker, I get a +2 when I Sneakily create advantages when Iâ€™m in conversation with someone.

\section{Dark past}

This is optional: To add depth, add a Lemming past. Most people alive in 2050 started out as Lemmings. Some shock made them choose a new, more sustainable philosophy. Either Norm, Lost or Pioneer.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item What was your life like as a Lemming?
    \item Did you have a job that can still be seen in your behaviour today (teacher of small children, preacher, bureaucrat)?
    \item Have you done anything that you now regret? Have you been on the wrong side of history?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item A bureaucrat slowing down progress ?
        \item A policeman smashing the first buds of the Solarpunk revolution you are now a part of.
        \item A politician taking bribes to keep the fossil fuel business alive?
    \end{enumerate}
    \item What made you change your mind?
    \item Do you keep your past life a secret ?
    \item Do you accept what you have done?
    \item Are you trying to repair the damage caused by your old self?
\end{enumerate}

Please discuss with your group first if you want to add the extra darkness when using Sins of the Past. And if you do: Create your own storylines for the characters with these sins. Make them "pay" for what they have done. But as this can break the solarpunk vibe. Only do this if you can really steer a positive Solarpunk story. This means: Not in your first campaign together
