\chapter{Factions}

Three relevant and playable factions exist int he Solarpunk world. Each one has their own approach. 

\begin{itemize}
    \item The creative and forward pushing Pioneerss
    \item The Norms, drawing strength from cooperation through AI power
    \item The Lost. Digging in the ruins of the old world and improvising with the old tech
\end{itemize}

Those factions are not enemies. And a sucessful team can require members from all three factions. But there is always a certain amount of friction between the different approaches those factions have to life, universe and everything.

Members of families can be associated to different factions. Or a person can move from faction to faction when their approach to life changes. This is not a big thing.

Also the factions are not well defined. There are hundreds of different Pioneer communities with their own approach of experimenting with a potential future. Hundreds of AI powered cities where the AI will shape the society differently because of the local own definition of a happy life. And lots of Lost families who found their own approach to survive and prosper in the wilderness.
