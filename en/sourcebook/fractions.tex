\chapter{Fractions}

Three relevant and playable fractions exist int he solarpunk world.

\begin{itemize}
    \item The creative and forward pushing Solarpunks
    \item The Norms, drawing strength from cooperation through AI power
    \item The Lost. Digging in the ruins of the old world and improvising with the old tech
\end{itemize}

Those fractions are not enemies. And a sucessful team can require members from all three fractions. But there is always a certain amount of friction between the different approaches those fractions have to life, universe and everything.
