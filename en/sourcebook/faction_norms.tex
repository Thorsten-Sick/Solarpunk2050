\section{Norms}

Norms life in upgraded cities with added solar panels, green parks, small streams of water and lakes. Everything is quite idyllic but you can still see the original buildings from the 2020 under the green walls.
The society is coordinated by AIs (one per town) and the goal of the AI is to improve quality of life.
To measure that every Norm carries a life logger which is a communication device like a mobile phone with AR interface. This is also the main tools to do their magic.

Someone from 2020 would call them wizards. Using Apps on their life logger they can request services from the AI. From refreshments to building a house. Based on available templates the AI will coordinate factories and Norm contractors (very spezialised ones) to build the customized request.
Delivery is within minutes (when ordering a gun with pearl-style grip) to days (adding a house to the city).

This is not limited to physical things but can also be an App to organize a Party.

But there are limits:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Things cost money. And material things will additionally cost resource points
    \item Apps must be unlocked first. Most of them by succeeding in a tutorial. This can take up to 2 years for an architecture App
    \item This magic will only work in the control area of an AI. And the supply lines must be open. The App will indicate if this service is not available
    \item Some services will also require a health check or other additional certificates
    \item The general rank of the user must be high enough
\end{itemize}

This is why most Norms focus on 1-2 topics and the usual 40 Apps everyone uses to simplify life.

A visiting Pioneer can get a life logger but will start on rank 0 (guest). Having only the basic Apps available (pizza service, ....) and no clue how to use them.

The real stars in the Norm world are those who can create new templates for new services. And amongst them only some geniuses can generate templates for highly complex products (like trains).
Those templates and their Apps unlock new wonders for the society.

Appearance: The norm world is (thanks to the templates) very uniform compared to the world of the Pioneers or the Lost. Everything is mass produced with some added personalisation. That includes the solar upgrades to houses and the clothes.
Chaos in the towns is created by the plants and animals that were allowed to spread.

Mobility: Mass transport. But with added quality of life (the self driving tram has a bar and a big TV screen for entertainment. People are standing in groups chatting and enjoying the ride.)
