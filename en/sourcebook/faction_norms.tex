\section{Norms}

Norms live in retrofitted cities with added solar panels, green parks, small streams of water and lakes. Everything is quite idyllic but you can still see the original buildings from the 2020 under the green walls.
As modern Norm tech is built based on templates, many items, clothes, fashion and architecture looks identical. Those templates can be personalised. And smart people do that. But they will never achieve the creative chaos the Pioneers have.

The cities are known as "hive cities", the Norm society is also quite often called a "hive". The reason for this is the tight and close coordination this society has.

This society is coordinated by AIs (one per town) with the goal to improve quality of life for the inhabitants.
To measure this quality of life every Norm carries a "hive controller". A communication device with AR interface. This is also the main tool to do their magic: "hive control".

Someone from 2020 would call them wizards. Using Augmented Reality Apps on their hive controller they can request services from the AI. These range from ordering refreshments to building a house. 
Based on available templates the AI will coordinate factories and Norm contractors (very specialised ones) to build and deliver the customized request by drone.
Delivery is within minutes (when ordering a gun with pearl-style grip) to days (adding a house to the city) as long as the Norm user is within city limits.

This skill is not limited to physical things but can also be an App to organize a Party for 500 people.

But there are limits:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Extraordinary things cost money. And material things will additionally cost resource points
    \item Apps must be unlocked first by succeeding in a tutorial. This can take up to 2 years for a complex architecture App
    \item This magic will only work in the control area of an AI. And the supply lines must be open. The App will indicate if a service is not available
    \item Some risky services will also require a health check or other additional certificates    
\end{itemize}

AI controlled hives are meshed. And a traveller can get similar services in most of the connected AI hives.

It is time consuming to finish the tutorials and requirements for the most complex Apps - most Norms focus on 1-2 topics and the usual 40 Apps everyone uses to simplify life.

A visiting Pioneer or Lost can get a hive controller but will start on rank 0 (toddler). Having only the basic Apps available (pizza service, ....) and no clue how to use them. Finishing the basic tutorials will require quite some time.

The real stars in the Norm world are those who can create new templates for new services. And amongst them only some geniuses can generate templates for highly complex products (like trains).
Those templates and their Apps unlock new wonders for the society and make the creators famous.

Appearance: The norm world is (thanks to the templates) uniform compared to the world of the Pioneers or the Lost. Everything is mass produced with some added personalisation. That includes the solar upgrades to houses and the clothes.

Despite that, some dynamics in the towns is created by the plants and animals that were allowed to spread.

Mobility: Mass transport. But with added quality of life (the self driving tram has a bar and a big TV screen for entertainment. People are standing in groups chatting and enjoying the ride.)

Daily life: Work is optional. All \hyperref[sec:basic income]{basic goods are available for free}. If someone choses to work 25h per week he will get paid in local Euro or other local currency. This can be spend on premium products and services. Jobs are very specific (like drone pilot for food deliveries, barista or medi-tech). People tend to have at least 1-2 hobbies they are very skilled at in addition to their job.

Norm society depends on a storage-building-sized AI controllers with communication interfaces in the city.

To spread Norm society to new towns the Norms normally start with a shipping container containing AI, communication interfaces and power. These "seed hives" have limited capability but are sufficient to bootstrap a new society. The AI in there is created from an empty template and can adopt to the situation. When set up the AI will establish a radio link to a partner city hive and start creating an inventory of local services and people with a hive controller in their area.

A Norm on expedition can still have some benefits by using a "personal hive" which is just a long range communication interface to the next city hive. With all the negative effects like: lag, broken connection, slow delivery...

\subsection{Skill: Hive control}

Being close to a hive and having a hive controller enables a Norm to request services from the Hive. The special skill "Hive control" is used for that.

The goal that needs to be rolled depends on the complexity of the task the Norm wants to achieve.

Sometimes and additional resource roll is necessary to check if the Norm has the Resource Points  for the required non-renewable resources.

If the hive-control dice roll fails, the reason could be:
\begin{itemize}
    \item User is required to complete some more tutorials first
    \item The App got an update....
    \item The hive is busy and this request can not be queued yet
    \item Basic components must be shipped from another hive first
    \item Hive controller down (which is an emergency !)
\end{itemize}

AI controlled areas can be in 4 quality ranges:

\begin{itemize}
    \item City hive: no penalty
    \item Seed hive (AI size: a shipping container): -2 on throw, slow delivery
    \item Personal hive (just a good communication interface to the next hive): -4, slow delivery
    \item No connection: Sorry.
\end{itemize}
