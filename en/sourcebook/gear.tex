\subsection{Pioneers: MIVs modular individual vehicles}

Pioneers love to experiment with new designs. To support rapid prototyping lots of their vehicles are based on a modular framework. The chassis is made out of struts and angle connectors. Engines and gear are flexible, same with batteries and hydrogen fuel cells. Steering is quite often drive-by-wire with microcontroller assistance. Much of the behaviour can be tuned by software.

Based on this framework anyone can build their vehicle within a few hours. Based on their taste and requirement. Number of passengers, acceleration, off-road capability, range, payload ... All that can be tuned individually.

It is so simple even kids can do that.

Pioneers interested in vehicles tend towards more drastic experiments (those listed are still considered entry level....):

\begin{itemize}
    \item AI controlled suspension
    \item Liquid nitrogen cooled superconductors
    \item Drone swarms to map the road ahead
    \item Chip tuning
    \item ultra light carbon frame
    \item solar panels for constant charging
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Norms: Trains}

Continent wide travel is done by train. For that to be convenient the trains have been improved tremendously.

A train carriage is autonomous. It can uncouple at any time there are two tracks in parallel and move to another train or to a train station. That way no one has to hurry to a train any more and can just board a carriage at any time and it will try to reach the next train heading in the right direction.
Trains can split on route and travel to different destinations.
A default carriage people can travel in already has : seating (which can be moved to sleeping position) - and tables, vending machines (free food and coffee), a cinema screen and washing room (including shower).

People can book their own carriage by hive controller. Adding some premium credits they can add special carriages to the train for recreation (and allow others to use those as well). With all those personalisation options and quality of life carriages a train feels more like a hotel.

Bonus carriages:

\begin{itemize}
    \item 4-5 stars restaurant
    \item Spa
    \item Library + coffee shop
    \item A proper cinema
    \item Adventure playground for kids, different themes (pirates, princess +castle, mad scientist lab, ...)
    \item Gym
    \item Garage for individual mobility + workshop
\end{itemize}

Sometimes a wagon with urgent deliveries will also attach to the train. But for large, heavy and slow goods there are special trains.

Norms made standard travel free. It is a basic right
