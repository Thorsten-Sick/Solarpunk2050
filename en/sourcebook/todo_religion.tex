\section{Religion and spirituality}

\begin{warning}
    Religion is a work in progress. I want to tread carefully as I do not want to hurt people. The rough outline is here for you to use in your group. More details and adventures will be added. With the help of experts for their beliefs. So far I only have access to Catholic theologians.
    My trick to solarpunkify things: Exaggerate, split the bad parts for new obstacles, make the good parts awesome. Go for "cultural appreciation" by learning as much as you can about the culture/religion and use that. As a GM or as a player. Aim for a wide range of aspects to make it entertaining (and not a one-trick pony). You can go deep for your own personal interest. But do not expect to be able to use this deep understanding of religion or culture in a TTRPG game....

Spirituality and religiosity are at the core of human existence. In 2050, people will have many opportunities to seek knowledge beyond the physical world.
However, the catastrophes of the recent past have had similar effects on all religions: All have clearly divided into a light and a dark side.

The dark side is driven by fear and the end of time (as the upheavals are interpreted). People in positions of authority use the teachings to exercise power over other people and restrict their freedom.

The Light Side offers people help and a path to higher realisation. Without coercion. But with more or less clear guidelines, depending on the philosophy. However, people are also encouraged to change philosophy if they come to a point on their path of life and realisation where other help would be important.

\subsection{The dark side}

The Dark Side is easier to embrace. But cooperation is not possible between different factions of the Dark Side. Even within the same faith there can be different Dark Side approaches (sects) competing for the one truth.
The great advantage of the Light Side is that they can cooperate. And without cooperation they will lose to the simpler and more seductive message of the Dark Side.

\subsection{Fighting the dark side}

The UN is asking all religions to fight their own dark side. They are creating groups of spiritual warriors to do this. These groups will either directly fight agents of the Dark Side, or help with rebuilding, community building, pilgrimages, caring for people, or recovering lost religious artefacts.

Knowing the past, the UN has set some rules for these groups:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The leader of the group must be of the same faith as the Dark Side group they are fighting (for reasons of responsibility, "It's your mess, you're gonna clean it up").
    \item Each group must consist of at least three different faiths (and the 45-page letter from a Catholic priest requesting that a Protestant Christian be considered a different faith was answered with "LOL, no").
    \item If it is not a combat mission, external witnesses must be involved to verify that the rules are being applied (this is a job for player characters. Just hope it does not suddenly become a combat mission)
\end{itemize}

Most of the missions these groups have are not combat missions, but things like organising a spiritual retreat or rescuing and rebuilding lost communities.

\subsection{Catholic church}

In the Catholic Church in 2030, there were already strong progressive currents (gay marriage, women priests, ecological free radio and solar power from church roofs) and conservatives (Latin liturgy, preaching away from the people, all climate catastrophes a punishment from God, the end is near). Both are strongly present in the church and a schism might have been the right way to go.

But it got worse.

The change began in 2035, when the new pope boldly called himself "Ratzinger I". Even the election was a bit strange. The Swiss Guard and emergency doctors were called to the conclave several times. But after the election of Pope Ratzinger I, all those involved confirmed that it was all just mistakes. This was the beginning of the Church's dark period and the rise of the Inquisition. The Inquisition scored its greatest coup when it interrogated the murderer of Pope Ratzinger I (the monk Ignazius, who strangled the Pope with a specially made rosary suitable for close combat) and uncovered a large progressive network in the Church and other religions and thinned it out in secret operations (regarding the other religions: the rosary was probably based on the weapons experience of the Shaolin monks. Eyewitness accounts of the assassination of the Pope, for example, also suggest that the murderer had undergone Shaolin training). Unfortunately, Ignazius died during the interrogation.

This orgy of violence by the Inquisition forced many Catholics to choose sides.

The choice of the next pope was simpler. Frederico - a reformer - was quickly appointed pope. He went down in history as Magdalena I, the first transsexual pope. Her reign continues and is very successful. Although she seems to have lost control of the Inquisition. But the Swiss Guard has so far been able to prevent all assassination attempts on the Pope or other church representatives.

The events described here took place over decades. And felt less implausible to many than the election of a reality star as US president in the 2020s.
