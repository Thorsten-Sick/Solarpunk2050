\chapter{World}

The world in 2050 is a world that is being rebuilt after several disasters triggered by climate change and other human mistakes shattered it.

\section{Wilderness}

Large areas are uninhabited and turned back into wilderness. Some old towns are still there - ruins that are not claimed yet.

The humans found several new ways to life those are the \hyperref[sec: Norms]{Norms}, \hyperref[sec: Lost]{Lost} and \hyperref[sec: Pioneers]{Pioneers}.

Their settlements are the seeds from which a new Solarpunk world can grow.

\section{UN}
\index{UN}
\label{sec: UN}

The UN is the only central organisation left after the catastrophe.

Its missions:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Rebuild global communication using drones, zeppelins and glas fiber
    \item Build an economy based on recycling using \hyperref[sec:Resource Points]{Resource Points}
    \item Find and dismantle \hyperref[sec: Relic]{Relics}
    \item Re-connect settlements lost during the catastrophes to civilisation
\end{itemize}

The UN has a few bases around the world. But mostly efforts are franchised and specialists are hired for the specific types of jobs.

\subsection{Equipment}

The UN has some special equipment and personell at their bases.

\subsubsection{Cargo Zeppelins}
\label{sec: UN Cargo Zeppelins}
\index{UN! Cargo Zeppelin}
Large Cargo Zeppelins. Able to carry up to 4 shipping containers of cargo. The solar cells in their hull make them black, their electric engines silent. This has the side effect to make them mobile bases in secret missions. But the original idea is to be able to be able to use them as floating power generators: They rise up to 500 meters, are wired to the ground and generate solar power for the ground part of the mission. In addition to that the engines can run in reverse and generate wind power.

\subsubsection{Away team}
\label{sec: UN away team}
\index{UN! Away team}
The away team can disembark from the Zeppelins using their E-paragliders and prepare the ground for landing the cargo or build an anchor for the Zeppelin. Those people are some of the best trained at the UN.
