\chapter{World}

The world in 2050 is a world that is being rebuilt after several disasters triggered by climate change and other human mistakes shattered it. It is not yet  a Solarpunk world. It is a world shattered by disasters. With bubbles of functional utopias of different styles.
Each faction has their own style of utopia. And even there there is lots of diversity.
And all those utopias a lacking something. The Solarpunk mission is now to learn from them and combine. Then distribute the benefits of those utopias.

This is the mission of the protagonists leaving their utopia bubble to help others. And maybe even face the reality of different approaches to an utopia.

\section{Wilderness}

Large areas are uninhabited and turned back into wilderness. Some old towns are still there - ruins that are not claimed yet.

The humans found several new ways to life those are the \hyperref[sec:Norms]{Norms}, \hyperref[sec:Lost]{Lost} and \hyperref[sec:Pioneers]{Pioneers}.

Their settlements are the seeds from which a new Solarpunk world can grow.

\section{Relics}
\index{Relic}
\label{sec: Relic}
Relics are objects or organisations from the past. They do not fit into the new world and will be dismantled soon. But as there are any relics there is a long list of tasks to do for dismantling. And some just soldier on until it is their turn. Or they fight back.

\section{UN}
\index{UN}
\label{sec: UN}

The UN is the only central organisation left after the catastrophe. They are the good guys leading rescue operations, rebuilding and they also introduced the Resource Point system. After breakdown of the nations the UN had to be reinvented. As the organisation it should always have been.

Its missions:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Rebuild global communication using drones, zeppelins and glass fibre
    \item Build an economy based on recycling using \hyperref[sec:Resource Points]{Resource Points}
    \item Find and dismantle \hyperref[sec: Relic]{Relics}
    \item Re-connect settlements lost during the catastrophes to civilisation
\end{itemize}

The UN has a few bases around the world. But mostly efforts are franchised and specialists are hired for the specific types of jobs.

This is what is publicly known. The truth behind that:

After catastrophes hit the globe and the UN became more important than ever the higher ranking UN officials (who picked their job for money and glory) left their seats silently. The UN was taken over in a friendly way by the lower ranks (who joined because they believed in the mission) and volunteers. The best operating UN headquarters of the UN are in the countries formerly known as "development countries". Which turned out to be in truth the non-stagnating countries.

Those volunteers run the rescue operations and are available in video conferences. If anyone asks for higher ranks they will get a reply in the line of "sorry, full schedule". But they can receive a signed letter or email (both fakes) if they want....

If anyone should be able to find one of the former upper ranks they will accept the credits and still claim to be responsible for all those successful projects.

\subsection{Equipment}

The UN has some special equipment and staff at their bases.

\subsubsection{Cargo Zeppelins}
\label{sec: UN Cargo Zeppelins}
\index{UN! Cargo Zeppelin}
Large Cargo Zeppelins. Able to carry up to 4 shipping containers of cargo. The solar cells in their hull make them black, their electric engines silent. This has the side effect to make them mobile bases in secret missions. But the original idea is to be able to use them as floating power generators: They rise up to 500 meters, are moored to the ground and generate solar power for the ground part of the mission. In addition to that the engines can run in reverse and generate wind power.

\subsubsection{Away team}
\label{sec: UN away team}
\index{UN! Away team}
The away team can disembark from the Zeppelins using their E-paragliders and prepare the ground for landing the cargo or build an anchor for the Zeppelin. Those people are some of the best trained at the UN.


\section{Resource points}
\index{Resource Points}
\label{sec:Resource Points}
Resource points are the main currency accepted by all factions. To avoid abuse of the nature every person gets a limited amount of them each year from the UN. They are required to get any non-renewable material based object. The ones appointed are enough for a normal life style. But not enough to build a brewery or other larger construct (problem for the Pioneers). Or just enough to buy diesel for the cars - and nothing else  (Lost). There are two ways to get more of those points:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Recycling objects. You bring your old phone back to the shop and get a new one. If you want more than just to replace your phone: Big objects or those made of rare materials return more resource points. Those objects you recycle must not be owned by someone ! This is one of the main reasons to start an adventure visiting the ruins of the Lemmings.
    \item Solving problems for the UN: The UN pays in resource points (the have an own budget for that) or in cash.
\end{itemize}

Those two additional ways to earn Resource Points are the only ways to transfer them to another entity. When recycling or solving tasks you are asked where to transfer the points to. You can pay someone, donate them or support your community or one of your projects. This is the only time you can direct the flow of Resource Points.

The Resource Point system is maintained by the UN. But everyone sane bought into it after witnessing the disasters. Cheating with resource points is regarded like cannibalism.



\section{Kessler Syndrome}
\index{Kessler Syndrome}
\label{sec: Kessler Syndrome}
A mass crash of satellites made the orbit around earth inaccessible. There are no weather satellites, GPS or map satellites left. No communication.
This is called "Kessler Syndrome". Leaving earth is high risk and no one tries that any more.

As replacement people are using high altitude drone planes, balloons and zepellins. Those only cover a small region and must be started intentionally. But this is better than nothing.
