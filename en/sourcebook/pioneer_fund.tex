\chapter{Pioneer Fund}
\label{ch:pioneer fund}

This is real. We are leaving the role playing game for an important announcement !

There are many real world Solarpunk initiatives. More than you perceive. But there is a special one: The \href{https://www.solarpunk-pioneers.org/}{Pioneer Fund} was inspired by this Role Playing game and picks the good parts from this narrative to make them reality. Any you can participate.

\begin{itemize}
    \item {Spread the word}
    \item {Inspire and be inspired - the fund needs more project ideas}
    \item {Use a recipe published there and start building}
    \item {Write Solarpunk narration (images, novels or Solarpunk 2050 adventures) and spread it}
    \item {Create a local Solarpunk community}
    \item {Contribute some money }
\end{itemize}

The Solarpunk fund is independent from this TTRPG, but Solarpunk 2050 is a major source for inspiration for this project. But you can contribute as well. You already do by running a Solarpunk TTRPG session with your friends.
Welcome to the "Narrative Department".
