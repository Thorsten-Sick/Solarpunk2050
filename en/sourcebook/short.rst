Factions
========

Norms
-----

Most of the population (the so called Norms) live in upraded cities. Solar panels produce energy, transport is public. Reducing the cars lead to free streets that can be used for parks and places to gather.
Society is more open minded and thanks to automation there is more free time to spend on consuming art (mostly series, music - and there is plenty of that).
The cities are governed by AIs which try to achieve the maximum quality of life for the people. But that can lead to interesting characters of those cities.
The Norms are specialised in one task and depend strongly on the AI supporting them. But thanks to that they have abilities people from the 2020s would describe as magic.

Example:

Architect (after 2 years of study): I can now place the room in my app next to the kitchen and we are done. Which color do you want the light switches to be ?
Customer (checks AR display of the house): Red. The new house looks great !
Architect: AI says the house will be ready in 2 days. It is already organizing the 500 special companies for the tasks. Now let's plan the party.

Without access to their local AI and socienty they lose lots of their abilities.

Pioneers
----------

Hyper progressive people building their own societies from scratch. They were essential when building the world the Norms now live in. But they just did not stop innovating when the world was safed.
Heroes of adventures are mostly Pioneers. They are flexible enough to find solutions where the Norm society just fails.

But sometimes their thirst for action causes chaos where a more structured approach of the Norm society would have been a netter option.

Pioneers life in communities that are experimental. The society there is experimental, the structure, the local economy ...

They prefer DIY approach to everything and are good tinkerers and scientists. Well, mad scientists. In a positive way.

Boring things is what Pioneers fail at...

The Lost (Die Verlorenen)
-------------------------

People who did not want to change. They a LARP-ing their own version of the 1990 where everything was better. Video on VHS, diesel cars, cheap meat.
Militaristic. Some Mad Max society. Most of the time they are the badies.

But there could be reasons to cooperate with them

* They know bushcraft more than anyone else. And some sunken old city must be explored
* They know the wild animals and the mutated wild animals - how to hunt them, how to cook them
* Their approach to history is the least skewed. Except for the 1990...which is their sacred ilussionary heaven.

Lemmings
--------

This is the society that came before the "Dirty road to Eden" stage. Always at the brink of self destruction. It is us...

Solarpunks and Norms deny to have been part of the Lemmings.
But this is everyone's origin or at least ancestors.

But there are alternative variants of what happened to the Lemmings:

* rich people build Mars/Moon or hollow earth colonies and will come back for revenge
* A chain of festivals in the 2030s where rich people have been last seen was later called the "Eat the rich festivals". But that is a joke, right ?

History
=======

Many people decided to forget or ignore history. The last 30 years were bumpy and some call them the "Dirty road to Eden". Especially active people like the Soalrpunks played roles in events. And some of those were necessary and dark.
So it is agreed that no one mentions that time.

An exception are the Lost. Who love to dig in history and are not attached to the Solarpunk world. But their view on the 1990s is very biased....

I will write more on the events later:
* "Eat the rich festivals"
* The inquisition and the election of Pope Magdalena I
* Geoengineering gone wrong with companies and individuals in Bond villain area
