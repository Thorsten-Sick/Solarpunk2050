\chapter{The Name of the Rose}
\label{ch:the name of the rose}

This adventure is less detailed and is aimed at the game master and players with Solarpunk 2050 world knowledge. It is better suited for improvisation.

It is best played after "Project Lifeguard" where the characters made friends in \hyperref[ch:project lifeguard]{Albstadt}. Even if the characters changed the players could be witness to the results of their endeavour.

\hyperref[subsec:Ravensburg]{Ravensburg} is special. During the night power is switched off. And the Hive in this Norm town will go offline. Please read the Ravensburg article for more details as they will affect the adventure.

\hyperref[subsec:Weingarten]{Weingarten}, the neighbouring town, is an 80s theme park with a mystery surrounding the missing Pioneer labs.

\section{Topic}

This adventure and the "Eat the rich festival" focus on capitalism and the alternatives to it.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Representatives of capitalism are the billionaires and the acolytes of the invisible hand.
    \item The Lost rely on barter transactions.
    \item The Norms are representatives of basic income with premium products.
    \item Pioneers are a meritocracy.
\end{itemize}

\section{Summary}

A Norm library club in \hyperref[subsec:Ravensburg]{Ravensburg} got a print of the original edition of the book "The Name of the Rose". They want to sell it to a group of Lost for a fair price (5 books).
At the same time a Norm movie, the 25 Episode of the "Eat the Rich Festival" series has premiere. Attracting the Norms to Ravensburg. Those two are connected.
The book is a palimpsest. Someone printed the "Name of the Rose" on the back of some printer paper containing diagnostic reports from the real "Eat the Rich Festivals" which happened 15 years ago. And according to these DNA data the modern myth repeated in the films is true !
While the protagonists try to get all three parts of the book and want to watch the movie and enjoy the after-show party another group is unveiled. The "Acolytes of the Invisible Hand" try to get the book and sell it back for cash.


\section{Getting started}

\subsection{Norms}
There is to be a new episode of "Eat the Rich festival". Episode 25, "Billionair Jambalaya". This will be streamed simultaneously on AR. But it will also be shown live in selected cinemas as a premium offer. With an atmospheric festival as the backdrop !
The Norms want premium tickets. But they are sold out in the current city. It is indicated that there are still many seats available in Ravensburg. So the idea is to travel there, register temporarily at this hive and then go in there with friends (the other characters).
This is the reason for Norms to travel to Ravensburg.

If \hyperref[sec:Jaime and Elisabeth]{Jaime and Elisabeth} became friends and they were helped in Albstadt, they might have organised that as a thank you.

\subsection{Lost}

There is a festive mood among the Lost (Lara from the Albstadt adventure is possibly to be accepted into the tribe). There will be a big ceremony. The player characters are invited. Then news arrives that a book is for sale in Ravensburg: the original of the "Name of the Rose". This is not yet in Alexandria (Lost will know what this means, everyone else will not).
In exchange for the book, the Ravensburg Norm Book Club only wants 5 reprints of other books.
They have often done business with them and are friendly with each other.
The characters are sent off.

\subsection{Pioneers}

Someone at the Pioneers has compiled a list of Pioneer labs. The laboratory in Weingarten (near Ravensburg) has not been heard of for a long time. Pioneer characters are given the task of investigating.

\section{In Ravensburg and Weingarten}

The characters are free to investigate. These sections are not in chronological order.

\subsection{The book}

\subsection{Pioneer mystery in Weingarten}

The Pioneers have left Weingarten because of constant hostility. They used to be in the old high school. But there is now a tidy meadow. The entire university was recycled by them in a very short time. Now there is a meadow.
There is a pillar with a riddle on it. It points to the Pioneers' retreat.

On the column there are markings with strips and two plugs into which you could plug an electrical device. One plaque reads:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, = 110
    \item Brown, Red, Orange, Green = 12 000
    \item Purple, Green, Green = <here is the slot>.
\end{itemize}

These are markings like you would find on electrical resistors. If you understand this and tinker and connect the correct resistor, a hatch opens for you. The correct resistor is 7.5 M Ohm.
(Note for the game master: There are apps that the players can use to calculate the resistance).

There are gears behind the hatch. One is missing.
You have to measure the missing gear wheel, plan it using CAD and print it out with a 3D printer. After inserting it, the mechanism turns. And a fountain rises out of the meadow.

The fountain consists of a dolphin statue and a basin.
The dolphin spits water into the basin. The basin is shaped like Lake Constance. The water enters the lake at about the town of Ãœberlingen.
That's where the Pioneers fled from the people in Weingarten. And founded Waterworld.
In Weingarten, you can find rumours among people about a quick departure. And a lot of resentment towards the Pioneers.

\subsection{Tastes like chicken}

\subsection{Acolytes of the invisible Hand}

The trouble is caused by the \hyperref[sec:acolytes of the invisible hand]{Acolytes of the invisible hand}, who operate openly - as they are all level 1 - and need to recruit new people into their Ponzi scheme. At the same time, a member of the book club has joined them and wants to use his part of the book to make money. Others in the group also want to make money and murder another member of the book club and search his house for the book.
