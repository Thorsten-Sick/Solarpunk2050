The idea is to exoerience an AI controlled town with a local culture maintained by AI algorithms and grown by like minded people moving there. This town is the perfect setting for a murder mistery.
The town Ravensburg started to transform when it switched off the public Wifi during the night in the year 2023. People who claim to suffer from "Electromagnetic hypersensitivity" convinced the local government to do that. After the change the slept better.
This was the start of the transformation of the town that became a Norm town int he next few decades. In the year 2050 the situation is: During the day it is a fully automated Norm town with electric public transport and AI support for oyur Hive controller. During the night everything electric is switched off.
"Electromagnetic hypersensitivity" is still no proven fact. But those people still claim to sleep much better now. The reason could be that after 8 pm there is no distraction anymore, lights are switched off and the town turns silent until 6 am.
Starting 2040 more "Electromagnetic hypersensitiv" people moved to Ravensburg. Further shifting the AI algorithm that is optimized for inhabitant wellbeing towards those nightly blackouts.

As the AI is not monitoring anything the night is the perfect time for crime.
The town is also very attractive for different types of adventurers:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Norms can be sent from other Hive towns to investigate why the log feeds coming from Ravensburg peak with alerts at 7:59 pm and crash to 0 at 8:00 pm
    \item Pioneers can be sent to find new solutions to bring a non-electric technology to Ravensburg to fill the nightly gap
    \item Lost will find a town that is not functional duiring nighttime (everyone retrats to the own appartment, best case: visiting friends for candlelight-and-wine evenings) and maybe help them with the side effects of the blackout
\end{itemize}

The topics adventure is "A radical measure that does not solve the problem. But will have positive and negative side effects and maybe even somehow fix the real issue (sleeping better) by accident" and "self re-inforcing cycles".

%% There is a rebel group secretly running wifi (with hidden SSID) and with the skills to switch off power LEDs on electronic devices.
