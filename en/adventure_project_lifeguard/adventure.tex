\chapter{Project lifeguard}
\label{ch:project lifeguard}

\section{Topic}

Goal is to build a new community (or several ones: one for each faction), stop the evil plans of an old company (which is a relic) and give people new hope.

The protagonists can be from any faction. A mixed group is best.

The start of the adventure is well planned to get everything running smoothly. The core of the adventure (Albstadt) is a sandbox with characters, trouble and locations.

Here the players can start helping the people, building a community, fight the relic and find new friends. They cooperate - up until they will have to decide which type of community they are about to build:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Pioneer style
    \item Norm style
    \item Lost style
\end{itemize}

Their behaviour towards the NPCs and the style of their solutions to the problems will topple the NPCs towards one faction's philosophy or the others. The GM should take note and adjust the behaviour of the played NPCs.

This is full sandbox and I hope there will be an interesting community with its own traditions built by the players at the end of the game.

\section{Summary}

There is a town (Albstadt from the Swabian Alps) which got lost during the Dirty Road to Eden. The currenty inhabitants improvise to survive but never called for help. About 10 years ago they got contacted by the "Project Lifeguard" which sends them survival items. Most of that is quite cheap and even breaks their own small projects to become indepentent (like: cheap food kills local farming projects). After 10 years some people vanished. Others assume this could be connected to the Project Lifeguard and finally travel outside of their settlement to a Norm town. Short investigation: This Project is unknown and does not exist.

% What happened to Albstadt ?

Truth is: Behind this project is an old company that is using a tunnel system in Albstadt to dump toxic waste. The Project Lifeguard is just a  cover story and a cheap way to buy the locals. All help sent is ment to build dependencies and control the local population.

But so far no one knows. The Protagonists will be hired by the UN to investigate. They have a chance to help the locals, build communities or city hives in their fashion and uncover the evil plans of the relic.

\begin{sidebarBox}[title=Relics]
Relics are objects or organisations from the past. They do not fit into the new world and will be dismantled soon. But as there are any relics there is a long list of todos for dismantling. And some just soldier on until it is their turn. Or they fight back.
\end{sidebarBox}

\section{Getting started}

The UN started a project and funded it. A group of people can earn Resource Points if they help investigate the Project Lifeguard and help the people of Albstadt by building a Lost family, a pioneer community or a Norm city hive (or all three of them) to integrate them back into civilisation.

First meeting is in the closest Norm town, the Sigmaringen Hive. The protagonists are invited. They can also meet the messenger who finally made a trip to civilisation and is a bit lost.

% How does the Sigmaringen Hive look like ?
% What can they get there (resources )?
% Who do they meet ?

\subsection{Scene one}

The player characters from all factions where called to the Norm town Sigmaringen for a UN meeting. No one knows yet why. But they know: payment for helping the UN is resource points.

They arrive independently and will meet at the location.

Sigmaringen is a nice and relaxed town. Many roads have been replaced by parks after 2020. Tame deer can be fed. Solar panels are attached to every available surface. Public transport is working flawless. There are many shelves where people can get free food and other thing of basic need. This is normal for the Norms and may seem strange for Lost and Pioneers.

Many Norms the visitors meet use the AR interface to origanize projects, chat, meet online....People on the street seem to gesticulate with arcane hand movements interacting with something no Lost or Pioneer can see - they have no Hive controller.

The meeting room in the castle was prepared. Someone got the "Emergency UN meeting props box" from the attic and decorated everything with large and small flags, placed cards on the table with UN logo, installed a UN logo on the big video screen in the room.

After all the characters arrived they are greeted by city officials who also do not know why everyone is here.

Perfect time for the characters to introduce each other before the UN meeting starts.

After a short time a UN official appears on the screen (from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia). Her name is Enku and she is experts for relics.

The characters receive a mission:
The next town "Albstadt" is a no-go area and a relic. It was destroyed when the caves under the area caved in. Thanks to low water levels over several years. A Lost family camped close by (the family of the characters in the meeting). Something strange happened. But the characters can tell the story themselves.

\subsection{Flashback for Lost}

(Here the Lost play a short session. This is what happened. Keep it short so the others do not get bored !)

Takeaways:

\begin{itemize}
    \item A person fled from Albstadt. It is still inhabited !
    \item another person chased this person. Obviously a professional fighter with illegal cyber augments (which means: replacement parts enhanced normal human abilities)
    \item The fleeing person claimed the project "Lifeguard" supports the town. But people vanish without a trace
\end{itemize}

The lost camp close to the Albstadt No-Go area. The camp is mobile and consists of diesel vehicles and tents. No Lost knows what happened in Albstadt 20 years ago. No one is allowed to go there. But they raid the outer ruins for stuff.

At the evening, while the "Risotto Rodenti" (containing rats, squirrels and especially invasive species) for the whole camp cooked they played Shakespear battle. Lost are educated and value history and old books a lot. The battle consists of one person starting to play a scene from an old theater play and handing over to another person who will have to continue without failing.

(The player characters are part of the battle-crowd. GM: Bring a copy of a page of a Shakespeare play so it can be played at the table).

While they played the guards at the perimeter stopped a person fleeing from Albstadt. The person wears rags. A Cyborg hunts this person. The Cyborg is quite high tech - which is illegal.

The guards at the perimeter stop the cyborg and do heavy damage with their guns. As soon as the cyborg loses the battle the cyberware self destructs and kills the person.

(The player characters are not art of the fight. But they can assist later: First aid, investigate the cyborg, ... This is why they know the essential info first hand).

The rescued person (named Hubert) tells a strange story:

He was born in Albstadt. Which is almost 100 percent destroyed. The caved in area made the whole town very vertical. Some ruins of buildings attached to rocky spikes. Caves are accessible now where no caves have been before. The people build makeshift bridges and were waiting for help. 10 years ago it arrived. Projekt Lifeguard came. The Cyborg was one of them.

They visit once a month and bring the bare minimum. Food, medicine, water, power. The town is fully dependend on them (which is the plan of project Lifeguard).

People started to disappear. This is why Hubert fled.

\subsection{Flashback for Norms}

The Norm people in the room got the UN task to investigate a few days ago. Their investigation happened in AR mode only while the characters were enjoying their free Latte Machiatto with Soy milk and cakes.



\subsection{Flashback for Pioneers}

The pioneers upgraded a building bot to a semi-autonomous bot. The bot is table sized, has 6 legs (with gecko grip), a nozzle to distribute a self hardening gooy substance for building and can either run tethered (power and substance comes through a hose) or with battery and goo storage for a short time span. It can be manually controlled or more interesting: run autonomously to print any kind of building, The inventor is in a wheelchair and decided that the autonomous mode only allows accessible structures: wide doors, no stairs.

This bot is called the "Beetle" and was painted by the Pioneer kids. This is why it looks like a multi colored real bug. And has glued on goggly eyes.

This tools is celebreated in the community and people challenge each other to build absurd things. This is happening as part of a building party where other projects are pushed as well.
 
At the end of the party the characters get a call from the UN to Sigmaringen. Something happened. They are neeeded. Bring the bot.

The inventor will not be able to join the adventure itself (wheelchair) but sends the characters.

The Beetle is the reason why this specific group of Pioneers have been summoned. The UN hopes it can be used to make parts of Albstad more accessible.

\section{Areas}

\subsection{Albstadt}

Albstadt was destroyed in a disaster. The karst area caved in. The landscape is more vertical with cliffs than horizontal now. Some buildings have be safed by structural fixes to keep them from totally falling into the ditches. There are improvised bridges everywhere. Caves have opened. Some are filled with water and need diving gear to reach the ground (where maybe some valuables from the earthquake ended up).
The people here did a good job at surviving in their broken town. But they did not dare to reach out for help. They were found by Project Lifeguard but the help sent through that made them even more dependent.




% What is left ? Church as city assembly. An old super market as source for tools, a museum for local history (really old farm tools),
% People life in shanty town, makeshift tents 
% How did the project replace essential things ? Power => Battery container, Food => Cans, Water => Bottles, Medicine => A doctor visits once a month
% Who is left ? Some people could build a sustainable life. Lifeguard is blocking that.
% How do they interact ? Some people love the dependency on PLG
% What can they find out ? Something is going on in the tunnels. The help is keeping people down. 
% How can they rebuild ? Start gardening, build water cisterns, 
% Who can be recruited & empowered ?
% How will PLG respond ? Sabotage and violence ? What before that ? Threats ?
% Supermarket owner gets gund by PLG to defend the last resources
% Person who wants to do medic only gets basic material and everyone has to wait for the monthly visit of PLG for real help
% There is a spy for PLG, but this spy can be turned and used against PLG

\subsection{People at Albstadt}

In Albstadt there are about 200-300 people. With some very active ones struggling, to keep everyone alive. But Project Life~-guard tricked them into non-sustainable ways to struggle and building more and more dependencies to Project Life~-guard. Those people could - using their skills smarter and more coordinated - build an in~-dependent Pioneer Community/~-Lost Family or Norm Hive. Until then they are a problem because they maintain the stupid structure tactically implemented by Project Lifeguard.

Those are the NPCs to interact with.

    He was a part of the 5 minute rebellion where Hubert fled. Being impulsive he threw rocks at the three people from project lifeguard. The Cyborg followed Hubert. A rock thrown by XXX hit an engineer, throwing him of a bridge and killing him. The third engineer did hide in their container. Some antenna got destroyed by thrown rocks.
    After the rebellion turned bloody XXX withdrew. Shocked by the own action.

% Responsible is the CSO (Central Strategic Officer) who does divide and conquor
% For the Solarpunk Community they offer "Recycling". In truth: They just dump the waste 

\subsection{Sigmaringen Hive}

Sigmaringen survived the earthquake that killed Albstadt. It became a Norm hive. In the center there is a castle on a hill. The Danube in the town is used by solar powered ambibious busses to travel around. They installed solar power wherever possible to power the city indepenently. And they allowed the surrounding forrest to enter the city in a controlled way. They especially allowed the tame deer in. Those are curious, dumb, always hungry, cute and can knock people over witha  playful headbut. But the tourists love them.
The town is reachable by train.

% Investigation: Who is bsehind the Project Lifeguard ?
% How can it be stopped ?
