\section{Topic}

Goal is to build a new community (or several ones: one for each faction), stop the evil plans of an old company (which is a relic) and give people new hope.

The protagonists can be from any faction. Mixed is best.

\section{Summary}

There is a town (Albstadt from the Swabian Alps) which got lost during the Dirty Road to Eden. The currenty inhabitants improvise to survive but never called for help. About 10 years ago they got contacted by the "Project Lifeguard" which sends them survival items. Most of that is quite cheap and even breaks their own small projects to become indepentent (like: cheap food kills local farming projects). After 10 years some people vanished. Others assume this could be connected to the Project Lifeguard and finally travel outside of their settlement to a Norm town. Short investigation: This Project is unknown and does not exist.

Truth is: Behind this project is an old company that is using a tunnel system in Albstadt to dump toxic waste. The Project Lifeguard is justa  cover story and a cheap way to buy the locals. All help sent is ment to build dependencies and control the local population.

But so far no one knows. The Protagonists will be hired by the EU (or sikmilar organisation) to investigate. They have a chance to help the locals, build communities or city hives in their fashion and uncover the evil plans of the relic.

\begin{sidebarBox}[title=Relics]
Relics are objects or organisations from the past. They do not fit into the new world and will be dismantled soon. But as there are any relics there is a long list of todos for dismantling. And some just soldier on until it is their turn. Or they fight back.

\section{Getting started}

The EU started a project and funded it. A group of people can earn Resource Points if they help investigate the Project Lifeguard and help the people of Albstadt by building a Lost family, a pioneer community or a Norm city hive (or all three of them) to integrate them back into civilisation.

First meeting is in the closest Norm town. The protagonists are invited. They can also meet the messenger who finally made a trip to civilisation and is a bit lost.

\section{Albstadt}

Albstadt was destroyed in a disaster.
The people here did a good job at surviving in their broken town. But they did not dare to reach out for help. They were found by Projekt Lifeguard but the help sent through that made them even more dependent.
