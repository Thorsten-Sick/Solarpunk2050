\section{Topic}

Goal is to build a new community (or several ones: one for each faction), stop the evil plans of an old company (which is a relic) and give people new hope.

The protagonists can be from any faction. Mixed is best.

\section{Summary}

There is a town (Albstadt from the Swabian Alps) which got lost during the Dirty Road to Eden. The currenty inhabitants improvise to survive but never called for help. About 10 years ago they got contacted by the "Project Lifeguard" which sends them survival items. Most of that is quite cheap and even breaks their own small projects to become indepentent (like: cheap food kills local farming projects). After 10 years some people vanished. Others assume this could be connected to the Project Lifeguard and finally travel outside of their settlement to a Norm town. Short investigation: This Project is unknown and does not exist.

% What happened to Albstadt ?

Truth is: Behind this project is an old company that is using a tunnel system in Albstadt to dump toxic waste. The Project Lifeguard is just a  cover story and a cheap way to buy the locals. All help sent is ment to build dependencies and control the local population.

But so far no one knows. The Protagonists will be hired by the UN to investigate. They have a chance to help the locals, build communities or city hives in their fashion and uncover the evil plans of the relic.

\begin{sidebarBox}[title=Relics]
Relics are objects or organisations from the past. They do not fit into the new world and will be dismantled soon. But as there are any relics there is a long list of todos for dismantling. And some just soldier on until it is their turn. Or they fight back.
\end{sidebarBox}

\section{Getting started}

The UN started a project and funded it. A group of people can earn Resource Points if they help investigate the Project Lifeguard and help the people of Albstadt by building a Lost family, a pioneer community or a Norm city hive (or all three of them) to integrate them back into civilisation.

First meeting is in the closest Norm town, the Sigmaringen Hive. The protagonists are invited. They can also meet the messenger who finally made a trip to civilisation and is a bit lost.

% How does the Sigmaringen Hive look like ?
% What can they get there (resources )?
% Who do they meet ?

\subsection{Start for Norms}

\subsection{Start for Pioneers}

The pioneers upgraded a building bot to a semi-autonomous bot. The bot is table sized, has 6 legs (with gecko grip), a nozzle to distribute a self hardening gooy substance or building and can either run tethered (power and substance comes through a hose) or with battery and goo storage for a short time span. It can be manually controlled or more interesting: run autonomously to print any kind of building, The inventor is in a wheelchair and decided that the autonomous mode only allows accessible structures: wide doors, no stairs.

This tools is celebreated in the community and people challenge each other to build absurd things. This is happening as part of a building party where other projects are pushed as well.
 
At the end of the party the characters get a call from the UN to Sigmaringen. Something happened. They are neeeded. Bring the bot.

The inventor will not be able to join the adventure itself (wheelchair) but sends the characters.

\subsection{Start for Lost}

The lost camp close to the Albstadt No-Go area. No one knows what happened there 20 years ago. No one is allowed there. But they raid the outer ruins for stuff.

An emergency training is started: Re-settle the whole camp to evac point B in 2 hours. Outriders start now. The Lost do that quite often to stay flexible And because they only trust themselfes.

At point B the outriders find a fight between a strange cyborg and a survivor who fled from Albstadt. They hopefully fught the cyborg and safe the man, get him to Sigmaringen and this starts the UN investigation.

\section{Areas}

\subsection{Albstadt}

Albstadt was destroyed in a disaster. The karst area caved in. The landscape is more vertical with cliffs than horizontal now. Some buildings have be safed by structural fixes to keep them from totally falling into the ditches. There are improvised bridges everywhere. Caves have opened. Some are filled with water and need diving gear to reach the ground (where maybe some valuables from the earthquake ended up).
The people here did a good job at surviving in their broken town. But they did not dare to reach out for help. They were found by Project Lifeguard but the help sent through that made them even more dependent.

% What is left ? Church as city assembly. An old super market as source for tools, a museum for local history (really old farm tools),
% People life in shanty town, makeshift tents 
% How did the project replace essential things ? Power => Battery container, Food => Cans, Water => Bottles, Medicine => A doctor visits once a month
% Who is left ? Some people could build a sustainable life. Lifeguard is blocking that.
% How do they interact ? Some people love the dependency on PLG
% What can they find out ? Something is going on in the tunnels. The help is keeping people down. 
% How can they rebuild ? Start gardening, build water cisterns, 
% Who can be recruited & empowered ?
% How will PLG respond ? Sabotage and violence ? What before that ? Threats ?
% Supermarket owner gets gund by PLG to defend the last resources
% Person who wants to do medic only gets basic material and everyone has to wait for the monthly visit of PLG for real help
% There is a spy for PLG, but this spy can be turned and used against PLG

\subsection{People at Albstadt}

In Albstadt there are about 200-300 people. With some very active ones struggling, to keep everyone alive. But Project Life~-guard tricked them into non-sustainable ways to struggle and building more and more dependencies to Project Life~-guard. Those people could - using their skills smarter and more coordinated - build an in~-dependent Pioneer Community/~-Lost Family or Norm Hive. Until then they are a problem because they maintain the stupid structure tactically implemented by Project Lifeguard.

Those are the NPCs to interact with.


\subsection{Project Lifeguard}

% Behaviour
% What can they do ?
% Responsible is the CSO (Central Strategic Officer) who does divide and conquor
% For the Solarpunk Community they offer "Recycling". In truth: They just dump the waste 

\subsection{Sigmaringen Hive}

Sigmaringen survived the earthquake that killed Albstadt. It became a Norm hive. In the center there is a castle on a hill. The Danube in the town is used by solar powered ambibious busses to travel around. They installed solar power wherever possible to power the city indepenently. And they allowed the surrounding forrest to enter the city in a controlled way. They especially allowed the tame deer in. Those are curious, dumb, always hungry, cute and can knock people over witha  playful headbut. But the tourists love them.
The town is reachable by train.

% How can it be stopped ?
