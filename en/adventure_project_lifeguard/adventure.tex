\chapter{Project lifeguard}
\label{ch:project lifeguard}

\section{Topic}

Goal is to build a new community (or several ones: one for each faction), stop the evil plans of an old company (which is a relic) and give people new hope.

The protagonists can be from any faction. A mixed group is best.

The start of the adventure is well planned to get everything running smoothly. The core of the adventure (Albstadt) is a sandbox with characters, trouble and locations.

Here the players can start helping the people, building a community, fight the relic and find new friends. They cooperate - up until they will have to decide which type of community they are about to build:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Pioneer style
    \item Norm style
    \item Lost style
\end{itemize}

Their behaviour towards the NPCs and the style of their solutions to the problems will topple the NPCs towards one faction's philosophy or the others. The GM should take note and adjust the behaviour of the played NPCs.

This is full sandbox and I expect the players will create a new and unique community with its own traditions.

\section{Summary}

There is a town (Albstadt from the Swabian Alps, Germany) which got lost during the Dirty Road to Eden. The currenty inhabitants improvise to survive but never called for help. About 10 years ago they got contacted by the "Project Lifeguard" which sends them survival items. Most of that is quite cheap and even breaks their own small projects to become indepentent (like: cheap food kills local farming projects). After 10 years some people vanished. Others assume this could be connected to the Project Lifeguard and finally travel outside of their settlement to a Norm town. Short investigation: This Project is unknown and does not exist.

Truth is: Behind this project is an old company that is using a tunnel system in Albstadt to dump toxic waste. The Project Lifeguard is just a  cover story and a cheap way to buy the locals. All help sent is ment to build dependencies and control the local population.

But so far no one knows. The Protagonists will be hired by the UN to investigate. They have a chance to help the locals, build communities or city hives in their fashion and uncover the evil plans of the relic.

\begin{sidebarBox}[title=Relics]
\hyperref[sec: Relic]{Relics} are objects or organisations from the past. They do not fit into the new world and will be dismantled soon. But as there are any relics there is a long list of todos for dismantling. And some just soldier on until it is their turn. Or they fight back.
\end{sidebarBox}

\begin{sidebarBox}[title=UN]
The \hyperref[sec: UN]{UN} is the last big institution left in 2050. It organised the global rescue efforts and introduced the Ressource Point system. They are the good guys.
But it is also a kind of "franchise". Decentralized small organisations are a key for local action. This is where player characters can get their jobs from !
It can pack a punch if a big effort is needed, but will not act without proof and a dire situation.
Local action is prefered.

The UN has some camps with heavy machines including VTOL (Vertical Take off and Landing) and style helicopters. They use it to rescue people in disasters. And can be called only after a detailed investigation by people on the ground - the exact type of the disaster and the local situation has to be known first. The next camp is in Stuttgart.
\end{sidebarBox}

\section{Getting started}

The UN started a project and funded it. A group of people can earn \hyperref[sec:Resource Points]{Resource Points} if they help investigate the Project Lifeguard and help the people of Albstadt by building a Lost family, a Pioneer community or a Norm city hive (or all three of them) to integrate them back into civilisation.

First meeting is in the closest Norm town, the Sigmaringen Hive. The protagonists are invited. They can also meet the messenger who finally made a trip to civilisation and is a bit lost.

\subsection{Scene one}

The player characters from all factions where called to the Norm town Sigmaringen for a UN meeting. Yet noo one knows why. But they know: payment for helping the UN is Resource Points.

They arrive independently and will meet at the location.

Sigmaringen is a nice and relaxed town. Many roads have been replaced by parks after 2020. Tame deer are walking around and can be fed (or they steal anything that looks like food). Solar panels are attached to every available surface. Public transport is working flawless and is based on amphibious busses to also use the Danube. Int he town and in the public vehicles there are shelves where people can get free food and other things of basic need. This is normal for the Norms and may seem strange for Lost and Pioneers.

Norms use their AR interface called "\hyperref[sec:Hive controller]{Hive controller}" to organize projects, chat, meet online....People on the street seem to gesticulate with arcane hand movements interacting with something no Lost or Pioneer can see - they have no Hive controller.

Non-Norm guests will also receive a Hive controller as a gift. These devices are not yet configured and the new users did not do any tutorials. The usability of those devices is very limited to what a 2 year old Norm could get out of his first device. But at least it the controllers have some Euro to pay for premium services during the trip to the UN meeting.

The meeting room in the castle was prepared. Someone got the "Emergency UN meeting props box" from the attic and decorated everything with large and small flags, placed cards on the table with UN logo, installed a UN logo on the big video screen in the room.

After all the characters arrived they are greeted by city officials who also do not know why everyone is here.

Perfect time for the characters to introduce each other before the UN meeting starts.

After a short time a UN official appears on the screen (from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia). Her name is Enku and she is experts for relics.
The connection to Africa is run over some glas fiber tracks, some high flying repeater drones and other network hacks. Satellites do not exist anymore after the Kessler effect.

The characters receive a mission:
The next town "Albstadt" is a no-go area and a relic. It was destroyed when the caves under the area caved in. Caused by low water levels over several years. A Lost family camped close by (the family of the characters in the meeting). Something strange happened. But the characters can tell the story themselves.

\subsection{Flashback for Lost: T minus 5}

Takeaways:

\begin{itemize}
    \item A person fled from Albstadt. It is still inhabited !
    \item Another person chased this person. Obviously a professional fighter with illegal Cyberware (which means: replacement parts enhanced normal human abilities)
    \item The fleeing person claimed the project "Lifeguard" supports the town. But people vanish without a trace
\end{itemize}

The lost camp close to the Albstadt No-Go area. The camp is mobile and consists of diesel vehicles and tents. No Lost knows what happened in Albstadt 20 years ago. No one is allowed to go there. But they raid the outer ruins for stuff.

At the evening, while the "Risotto Rodenti" (containing rats, squirrels and especially invasive species) for the whole camp cooked they played Shakespear battle. Lost are educated and value history and old books a lot. The battle consists of one person starting to play a scene from an old theater play and handing over to another person who will have to continue without failing. This is a drinking game and will turn into a chaotic situation.

(The player characters are part of the battle-crowd. GM: Bring a copy of a page of a Shakespeare play so it can be played at the table).

While they play the guards at the perimeter stop a person fleeing from Albstadt. The person wears rags. A Cyborg hunts this person. The Cyberware implanted into the Cyborg is obviously illegal.

The guards at the perimeter stop the Cyborg by causing heavy damage. As soon as the Cyborg loses the battle the Cyberware self destructs and kills the him.

(The player characters are not part of the fight. But they can assist later: First aid, investigate the cyborg, ... This is why they know the essential info first hand).

The rescued person (named Kim) tells a strange story:

He was born in Albstadt. Which is almost 100 percent destroyed. The caved in area made the whole town very vertical. Some ruins of buildings attached to rocky spikes. Caves are accessible now where no caves have been before. The people build makeshift bridges and were waiting for help. 10 years ago it arrived. \textbf{Project Lifeguard} came. The Cyborg was one of them.

They visit once a month and bring the bare minimum. Food, medicine, water, power (a fuel cell in a cargo container and enough hydrogen for a month). The town is fully dependend on them (which is the plan of project Lifeguard).

People started to disappear. This is why Kim fled.

Kim will be brought to a hospital in Sigmaringen. As soon as he gains conciousness he will be questioned and can be witness in the UN meeting later via video call.

\subsection{Flashback for Norms: T minus 3}

The Norm people in the room got the UN task to investigate a few days ago. Their investigation happened in AR mode only while the characters were enjoying their free Latte Machiatto with Soy milk and cakes somewhere at a Danube beach in Sigmaringen.

By phoning people, going through online databases, checking web cams and controlling drones they can learn:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The containers with the project logo are from Sigmaringen
    \item Officially they never start there
    \item A company called "Dumpit waste management inc" has the same ware house and is a daughter company of "Cargo !" which does all kind of shipping using Zeppelins
    \item The "Dumpit" containers are shipped by Zeppelins drones to Albstadt
    \item The Project Lifeguard is not registered anywhere !
    \item Dumpit also ships waste container the same way - passing Albstadt and sending them to a recycling plant in Luxemburg (this is the official version. In reality they just dump the wast in Albstadt. This is not revealed yet)
\end{itemize}

Entering the "Cargo !" container area they will learn that the container all look the same with a printed on ID code. The logo on the containers can be changed within seconds because it is just a giant multi-color e-paper. This is also why no "Project Lifeguard" container can be found there but literally appears in mid air.

A cargo Zeppelin can carry 4 containers it can lower with a crane. A defaul run to Luxemburg is 1 Dumpit waste container and 3 Project Lifeguard containers. They all start with the Dumpit logo.

\subsection{Flashback for Pioneers: T minus 2}

The UN needs a scout robot with building capability in this region. Fast. The Pioneer community advertised their robot some time ago and this is why they get a call to send their robot and 1-2 operators for it.

The UN call gets everyone hyped. So the community decides to do a party and some last-minute fixes....

Those fixes are all introduced by mildly intoxicated crazy engineers (Pioneers....) and harvest parts from other projects. The player characters can defend the current features of the robot or push on. For every fix a "Prototyping" roll is made and the robot gains the listed features, on failed dice throw it will also get a new glitch. See table for ideas.

The robot starts as a semi-autonomous building bot. The bot is table sized, has 6 legs, a nozzle to distribute a self hardening concrete for building and can run with battery and concrete storage of 6 bucket sized containers. It is remote controlled.

Modifications, suggested by the pary people:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Gecko grip (on fail: will accidentially stick to people and other objects)
    \item Waterproof, 10 meters (on fail: building gets flooded during test run)    
    \item Other material: wood pulp, plastic (on fail: ugly test object sticks to the floor an no one knows how to remove it)
    \item Can process wood into wood pulp (on fail: people kept feeding it furniture in their enthusiasm)
    \item Feed pipe for large scale projects (on fail: The community is now in possession of a large scale video character monument....)
    \item Autonomous option (on fail: starts printing strange objects when no one is looking)
    \item Colour cartridge (on fail: can only print rainbow coloured things now)
\end{itemize}

Finally the pioneer kids will paint it with shiny colours beetly style and add goggly eyes. This is not optional.

After that the delegation leaves for Sigmaringen, with the robot.

\section{Areas}

\subsection{Sigmaringen}

The protagonists can start investigating in Sigmaringen. Here they can find a mesh of companies and shell companies all belonging to "Cargo !".

\subsubsection{Zeppelin pilot Luke}

Luke is the Zeppelin pilot for "Cargo !". He has the strong suspicion that something is wrong with the Dumit job. But he also knows: investigating and digging deeper will just confirm it and then he will have to decide if he wants to keep a good job or not. When approached on a personal level a very good \textbf{Rapport} job could get some information out of him:

\begin{itemize}
    \item He never flies to Luxemburg
    \item There is a stop in Albstadt
    \item It is not a wasteland as expected. But he will not tell more
    \item He starts with 4 Dumpit containers (not mentioning 3 will be rebranded midflight)
    \item He never mentions what happens to those containers in Albstadt. Not the 3 dropped at the Supermarket, not the one emptied into the "bottomless sinkhole"
\end{itemize}

Some of those topics make him feel uncomfortable. He will evade talking about his favourite show he watches while flying his delivery tours.

\subsection{Albstadt}

Albstadt was destroyed in a disaster. The karst area caved in. The landscape is more vertical with cliffs than horizontal now. Some buildings have be safed by structural fixes to keep them from totally falling into the ditches. There are improvised bridges everywhere. Caves have opened. Some are filled with water and need diving gear to reach the ground (where maybe some valuables from the earthquake ended up).
The people here did a good job at surviving in their broken town. But they did not dare to reach out for help. They were found by Project Lifeguard but the help sent through that made them even more dependent.

For the cave system: Check out "Blautopf" on wikipedia. 

\subsubsection{General}

Albstadt is a maze of spires, where the tops of the spires are at ground level. The canyon system is filled with water and caves (dry or filled with water) are everywhere.

Old buildings either survived at the top of the spires or are hanging at the side. With heavy damage and secured by ropes.

Between the spires there are improvised suspension bridges and supply lines to the supermarket (power, water). All of that needs repair or replacement.

At the beginning of the adventure the Sigmaringen hive will drop a radio repeater close to Albstadt. The Norms will have a connection to the Sigmaringen hive. No dice penalty but delivery time is +1h.
In addition they will get expenses of a few Resource Points to spend on whatever they need there.

\subsubsection{Forrest}

The forrest is dangerous. Sinkholes and boars make it almost inaccessible. It surrounds Albstadt and is the first reason this is a no-go area.

\textbf{Problem:} Wild boars and sinkholes
\textbf{Solutions:} Boars can be hunted, trapped or kept away. Sinkholes can be fixed by analysing the ground or building bridges and walkways between the trees. 
\textbf{Benefits:} Fertile soil for farming and tasty animals

\subsubsection{Supermarket}

The supermarket is the largest surviving structure. It is controlled by Ash and his goons. Ash is the local despot. The parking space in front of the supermarket is where the containers are dropped by cargo zeppelins. Those are instantly secured by Ash and the goons.

While the parking space and the main building of the supermarket look intact the whole backside wall is missing. It fell down the side of the spire. From a security perspective this is not an issue because no one living there could climb up the spire wall and enter that way. Or build a bridge or stairs by using a robot - this is an option the protagonists have.

In the Supermarket there are lots of shelves with an epic amount of food and tools. A small but fancy set of rooms where Ash lives and Ash's office. Here he keeps all the dirty secrets he collected about Dumpit.

\textbf{Problem:} It is controlled by Ash and his goons. He uses it to control the whole town by artificial scarcity
\textbf{Solutions:} Get rid of Ash, blackmail him, force him anotehr way, ....
\textbf{Benefits:} A building for storage, crafting, town center, ....

\subsubsection{Leo's}

\textbf{Leo} tried to fix his building and spire as good as possible. But was lacking material or technology. In his current state he can not help - but maybe after things are fixed somehow.

\textbf{Problem:} Leo does not have the technology to properly build what he wants to build
\textbf{Solutions:} Scale up, use Pioneer tech, order stuff from Sigmaringen
\textbf{Benefits:} A first hanging garden, proper bridges and supply lines. A showcase

\subsubsection{Lara's}

\textbf{Lara} lifes in a old house with broken roof on a spire. Here she cares for three poisoned people. The only special thing about her spire is a long ladder reaching down to the small dock she built at the water level where she keeps here canoe.
In her home she cares for three ill people. They all went to the secret Dumpit cave downriver and brought back a "glows in the dark" lucky charm. A shard of radioactive material which was part of the waste dumped there. This shard made caused radiation sickness.

\subsubsection{Water level maze}

This is where \textbf{Lara} spends her time: 200 m below the top of the spires. There are water ways with beaches, rapids, caves and large rocks in the water.

A small boat or canoes will be relevant for traveling.

There are a lot of dangerous caves. Plus one where the toxic waste was dumped. Staying there without protective equipment can be dangerous. Also: Do not eat the crabs there.

%% https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orphan_source

\textbf{Problem:} American crabs are eating the local life
\textbf{Solutions:} Build traps, eat the crabs
\textbf{Benefits:} Food

\subsubsection{Sams bunker}

\textbf{Sam} hides in a bunker like control structure. Built to house 20 people it was the home of 3 until recently (the cyborg and Sams collegue got killed).

Sam hides there now.

\textbf{Problem:} Sam is scared and hiding there.
\textbf{Solutions:} Talk, produce some prove the situation calmed down
\textbf{Benefits:} Workshop, drones and information

% What is left ? Church as city assembly. An old super market as source for tools, a museum for local history (really old farm tools),
% People life in shanty town, makeshift tents 
% How did the project replace essential things ? Power => Battery container, Food => Cans, Water => Bottles, Medicine => A doctor visits once a month
% Who is left ? Some people could build a sustainable life. Lifeguard is blocking that.
% How do they interact ? Some people love the dependency on PLG
% What can they find out ? Something is going on in the tunnels. The help is keeping people down. 
% How can they rebuild ? Start gardening, build water cisterns, 
% Who can be recruited & empowered ?
% How will PLG respond ? Sabotage and violence ? What before that ? Threats ?
% Supermarket owner gets gund by PLG to defend the last resources
% Person who wants to do medic only gets basic material and everyone has to wait for the monthly visit of PLG for real help
% There is a spy for PLG, but this spy can be turned and used against PLG

\subsection{People at Albstadt}

In Albstadt there are about 200-300 people. Most of the people suffer from learned helplesness aquired in the last 30 years. They even forgot how to cook and just use the microwaves with the pre prepared meals offered by Project Lifeguard. With some very active ones struggling to keep everyone alive. But Project Life~-guard tricked them into non-sustainable ways to struggle and building more and more dependencies to Project Life~-guard. Those people could - using their skills smarter and more coordinated - build an in~-dependent Pioneer Community/~-Lost Family or Norm Hive. Until then they are a problem because they maintain the stupid structure tactically implemented by Project Lifeguard.

Those are the NPCs to interact with.

    An impulsive architect, has a spire with a house on it. He tries to farm the side of the rock by attaching small boxes for plants.
    He was a part of the 5 minute rebellion where Kim fled. Being impulsive he threw rocks at the three people from project lifeguard. The Cyborg followed Kim. A rock thrown by Leo hit an engineer, throwing him of a bridge and killing him. The third engineer did hide in their container. Some antenna got destroyed by thrown rocks.

    The old supermarket is the central hub for food, resources and power. Everything is delivered there. The owner of the supermarket got recruited to distribute it. Power corrupted him. He controls the town.

    He already has some dirty secrets he uses to blackmail Dumpit. But to get even more power over his masters (the Project) he wants to investigate whats in the secret site.
    
    Ash is the real baddie

    \textbf{Location:} Supermarket
    \textbf{Problem:} Dependent on the Project Lifeguard. Wants to blackmail them. Just in case.
    \textbf{When convinced:} Can not be convinced. Just blackmailed, forced, .... will then offer control over the whole settlement

\subsection{Project Lifeguard by Dumpit waste management inc.}

History:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item 30 years ago Albstadt was destroyed by the disaster
    \item People managed to survive
    \item 10 years ago Dumpit discovered the settlement. It wanted to use this region for illegal waste disposal
    \item It started a humanitarian aid project in parallel to the dump investigation.
    \item It kept the settlement a secret to not harm their illegal business
    \item Quite soon Ash found out about this illegal part of the project and started to blackmail Dumpit
    \item Ash's goal was to get into a control position for the aid. Which he did. And became the de-facto ruler of Albstadt
    \item Dumpit inc is ok with this arrangement
\end{enumerate}

Project Lifeguard is a project of a relic company - and old company that will be dismantled as soon as the UN has some time. As it is small and seems non-relevant it is way down at the bottom of the backlog.
Dumpit waste management Inc is officially there to recycle waste. Their dirty secret: Toxic waste is dumped into a natural chimney in the Albstadt territory. Where it falls down some hundred meters and ends up in a natural cave filled with water. This cave can be accessed from the side by skilled divers. People did that and some of them died after a long illness. This is why the call the cave "haunted". But no one in Albstadt connected the dots.

The reason is "Project Lifeguard". This is the cover story told to the people in Albstadt. A humanitarian aid sent there. But it is designed in a way to make the people dependent. At the same time they send a container with toxic waste by helicopter, three containers are dropped at the supermarket: One with food and water, one with power (hydrogen generators) and one with clothes and tools.
Those are barely anough for the people there to survive. But it makes them dependent and breaks all endeavours to grow their own food, clean the water or install power generators.
The other thing why they can not abort their aid project is that Ash has enough on them to blackmail the company. His power depends on the resources delivered by Project Lifeguard.

A small outpost (manned with three people) is there to monitor everything. But the leave the people alone most of the time and use drones and cameras.

Before the adventure starts, one engineer is killed by Leo who was throwing a stone. The security cyborg followed the fleeing Kim and was killed by the Lost.
The last engineer and medic Sam is hiding in the bunker during the adventure.

One secret which is hard to spot are the two sattelite dishes for communication.

The obvious one is directed towards a stratosphere relay zeppelin to communicate with the company.

The more obscure dish is always directed towards the moon.

\begin{sidebarBox}[title=Kessler Syndrome]

    \hyperref[sec: sec: Kessler Syndrome]{The Kessler Syndrome} is killed all GPS satellites, earth mapping and communication satellites. The earth orbit is inaccessible. The only fallback left are high flying drones for mapping and as communication relay.
\end{sidebarBox}


\begin{sidebarBox}[title=Moon base]

    There is no moon base. None that people would be aware of. Early in the Dirty Road to Eden phase the billionairs left earth. For the moon, Mars and some even digging tunnels below earth. No one is aware of that. Thanks to the Kessler Syndrome (which was caused by the last one leaving earth) they could not be followed even if people would realize what happened.
    In their secret bases they continue dreaming their capitalistic dream and influencing earth. Fighting to keep relic companies alive.

    But this will be handled in more details in another adventure. That will also cover the so called "Eat the rich festivals". The only hint in this adventure that there could be something big going on is the antenna pointed at the moon.
\end{sidebarBox}

Endgame: If enough of their evil plans are uncovered the UN can put this relic right at the top of the dismantle-todo-list. Lawyers and security forces will be raiding the HQ. The company assets will be seized.

\subsection{Sigmaringen Hive}

Sigmaringen survived the earthquake that killed Albstadt. It became a Norm hive. In the center there is a castle on a hill. The Danube in the town is used by solar powered ambibious busses to travel around. They installed solar power wherever possible to power the city indepenently. And they allowed the surrounding forrest to enter the city in a controlled way. They especially allowed the tame deer in. Those are curious, dumb, always hungry, cute and can knock people over witha  playful headbut. But the tourists love them.
The town is reachable by train.

% How can it be stopped ?

\section{Potential solutions}

There are many options. If your players find one not listed here, please contact me.

\subsection{Call the UN}

With enough proof the characters could call the UN. The UN will fast forward the termination of Dumpit (by tomorrow) and send troops to secure the area and evacuate the people:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \hyperref[sec: UN away team]{Several UN away teams}
    \item 6 \hyperref[sec: UN Cargo Zeppelins]{UN Cargo Zeppelins}
\end{itemize}

Before the support can arrive the landing zone (parking space in front of supermarket) must be freed of containers. They could be pushed down the spire with heavy machinery. The protagonists will also have to secretly install electronic guidance systems there. After that they can watch the UN intervention from another spire.

\subsection{Walkaway}

By finding a safe route through the forrest the people can just leave. If the characters can convince them it is safe and there is a world outside Albstadt that would welcome them.

\subsection{Independence}

Teach the people how to grow and catch their own food, test the water for drinkability and build power sources. Ash's grip will break very fast.

\subsection{More proof}

Enter the haunted cave and find more proof about the wrongdoing of Dumpit. Present it to the UN and they will terminate the company immediately (it was kept alive because it promised recycling of the waste, not dumping). No company. No Ash. But sooner or later Albstadt will be running our of food.
