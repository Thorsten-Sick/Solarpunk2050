\chapter{Introduction}


Solarpunk is a utopian Science Fiction genre. \textbf{Solarpunk 2050} is the Fate setting where this goal is almost reached. The protagonists, so-called Pioneers, live in ecological, technology-friendly and socially progressive communities. Close to the big cities where the so called Norms go about their daily lives - coddled by their AI.

This adventure is part of the Solarpunk 2050 setting but contains everything to start playing. It is based on "Fate Condensed".
