\chapter{The Lost flea market}

There are many Lost flea markets. This one is mobile. It travels around the country, creating a meeting point for different Lost groups. However, some Norms and Pioneers are also attracted to it and are left confused.

A radio message notifies the Lost community when a flea market is taking place in their area. It's an important event. However, organising these markets requires a great deal of effort. By a very special kind of people.

These people will be introduced here.

\section{If it succeeds....}

If the flea market is successful this time, it will be a mixture of smells, including food, unplugged music, trade and barter, theatre, and the noise of blacksmiths and animals. Different dialects mingle. It is a giant, low-tech festival where normally hostile groups meet.

Friendships are formed. Plans are made and goods, stories and rumours are traded.

At night, torches and campfires light it up. People chat, sing and tell stories late into the night. People drink, smoke and eat together.

After about two weeks, all 500 people have left.

Great things can happen in those two weeks:

\subsection{Random events}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Old Jacob wants to share his famous bathtub gin recipe before he dies. He will reveal this secret to the first three people to bring him a special alcoholic beverage.
    \item At night there is a spontaneous fire-juggling show
    \item Someone is running a quiz 'The 1980se'. You can win a bottle of Jacob's bathtub-gin.
    \item Two people are getting engaged. To celebrate, a whole pig is being barbecued. Norms and pioneers alike may experience culture shock.
    \item There is a Shakespeare competition. Two groups are competing, but they still need actors for some roles.
    \item Both adults and children over the age of 14 can learn to shoot a semi-automatic weapon at the shooting range. This may confuse some Norms.
\end{enumerate}


\chapter{The task}

The flea market team travels around, announcing the event on the radio and preparing for around 500 people. Most of those Lost will contribute to the flea market. They will contribute by selling food, running craft stalls and so on.

The flea market team provides the base infrastructure. They also try to connect hostile Lost groups. This is one of the reasons for creating a flea market (others include trade, knowledge and entertainment).

Player characters could arrive while the flea market is being set up. They could help out and make new friends. After two weeks, everyone will move on.

\section{The problems}

Building a flea market is never straightforward. Expect problems. Thankfully, NPCs, the protagonists and perhaps some early arrivals will solve them.

\subsection{Random events during set up}

\begin{enumerate}
\item A guest group arrives too late - what could have happened ?
\item A guest group arrives too early
\item The field where the planned flea market is to be held is flooded after heavy rain. It has turned into a lake. It is full of stinging nettles and scrub.
\item A buried Lemming ruin has been found where the flea market is due to be built. The Jones-es want to loot it. This could lead to a dungeon crawl.
\item The creation of the flea market is slowing down. Everyone is distracted by the tasty food.
\item Curious children from the nearby Pioneer camp come to visit in their exoskeletons. Lost are caught between feeling scared and protective because of the technology.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Wendy and family}

The plot of the NPCs Wendy and her family is akin to a telenovela drama. If you don't want this kind of plot, remove or modify it.

\chapter{The NPCs}

\section{Animal expert: Jonas Ohnesorg}

He organises shelter for animals ranging from rabbits to cattle. In doing so, he also ensures the health of the bartered animals and the supply of feed. He also runs a local butcher's shop. When he is not organising the flea market, he is a trainer for birds of prey. However, sometimes these birds catch rabbits, including those owned by farmers.

\section{Kitchen and military tactics: Gustav Müller}

His core theses: order, discipline and sauces are central

Favourite silly saying: 'No food, no fight'

There is little difference between managing a kitchen and organising a battle. For him, both involve leading small units. His attitude leads him to defend the Lost Camp or to set up a large kitchen for a flea market. His imperious military manner may bring him success, but it also makes him enemies.

Head of logistics, heavy machinery and truck driver: Wendy (formerly Wilhelm). Her marriage to Doris broke down before the disaster. She didn't know why. Later, she realised that she was transgender and therefore a woman. She has a photo from the old days behind her sun visor. It shows him with Doris, his wife. Before the disasters, they used to travel through Europe in their truck. The marriage failed because Wilhelm/Wendy was always on the road and Doris was more settled. They have one child, “Flash”.

\chapter{Other groups}

Lost flea markets aim to bring together several Lost groups. However, it is often easy to find slightly confused Pioneers and Norms.

\section{Jones-es}

This is the name of a group that searches the ruins of the lemmings for technology, books and other valuable or interesting items. They offer their latest finds in exchange for medicines and repairs.

\subsection{Random discoveries from the ruins}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item A crate of old and well-preserved wine bottles. And lots of tins of ravioli.
    \item Perry Rhodan Silver Volumes
    \item Private video tapes from the 1990s – what could be on them?
    \item An old map of this region. However, many of the places no longer exist after the disasters. Is an expedition worthwhile?
    \item A child's essay entitled “This is how I imagine the future”. What does it say ? What did become of that child.
    \item A box with old board games.
\end{enumerate}

The most valuable artefacts are those from the old world that the Lost have recovered during their expeditions. The artefacts of the Lemmings. The Lost in particular rely on ancient technology to repair their vehicles and buildings. Books themselves, however, have an almost spiritual value for the Lost, and rare copies are secretly traded at flea markets. Until someone brings them to “Alexandria” to gain fame, where they are copied and reproduced

Incidentally, Lost people trade in barter, Norms pay with digital money, and among Pioneers, many transactions take place based on the reputation and fame of the individuals involved. At a Lost flea market, culture shock and chaotic chains of barter are therefore inevitable, especially for non-Lost people.

\section{Farmer}

Looking for animals for breeding and plant seeds. They are willing to pay in kind. Spontaneous slaughtering for festive roasts is also to be expected. The large number of animals can cause a manure disposal problem and a terrible stench if this is not planned for in advance.

\section{Craftspeople}

They offer repairs, but they need raw materials.

\section{The fair}

Of course, there are hundreds more people from other groups who cook, repair, sell, buy, read aloud, play music, search and run a fair with all kinds of stalls and attractions. Popular with children: betting on a mouse in a maze: which exit will it take?
