\chapter{To the moon}
\label{ch:To the moon}

\section{Topic}

Hunting the billionairs the protagonists arrive in Überlingen. Meeting a strange esoteric culture. Here they will have to decide how to handle facts, freedom and the fate of the people.
One step closer to the hideout of the billionair they will meet the Pioneer community that fled Weingarten: Waterworld.

Here they will encounter the body of a Acolyte of the invisible hand who searched for the hideout - killed by Pirates on the Lake of Constance.

Hired by the Master Acolythe the pioneers will have to build a submarine themselves (maybe with the help of the sea witch).

Deep under the surface of the Lake of Constance the billionairs built a bunker. Occupied by Nestor - a loyal servant of his master.

The master himself is on the moon. Waiting for an Acolyte to succeed in finding the bunker. In a video conference the protagonists can speak to one of the villains directly - for the first time.

They can get access to one of the locked safes in the bunker - containing enough tools to capitalism-form the earth making it ready for the return of the billionairs.

They will also learn that this is just one of hundreds of hidden bunkers the billionairs left behind for their servants. This is the best time to contact the UN, raise the red alert and be ready to receive their next task from the UN:

Assemble as many Norms, Pioneers and Lost as possible. Enable them to face the billionairs should they return. But without telling them the truth - because this does not sound credible.

\section{What really happened}

The billionairs left for the moon. All of them. They left hundreds of secret bunkers behind. With all the tools to required to capitalism-form earth. The protagonist will find one at the end of the adventure. And will have the power to end Solarpunk.
Or help the UN prepare everyone to fight back what will be the counter revolution. Which will start as soon as an Acolythe of the invisible hand controls one of those bunkers.

To reach the bunker the protagonists will explore the Überlingen environment:
\begin{itemize}
    \item {Überlingen, the esoteric town at the shore of the Lake of Constance. Miracles work here !}
    \item {Waterworld. The refuge of the \hyperref[subsec:Weingarten]{Weingarten} Pioneers}
    \item {The Suisse pirate fleet}
    \item {A underwater bunker with everything prepared to conquer the planet}
\end{itemize}


\section{Überlingen (green zone where it starts)}

The AI uses technology, science and applied stage magic to make miracles work. The esoteric inhabitants are cheated by that - and happy.

\subsection{Astrological signs}

Upon arrival everyone with a Hive controller will be asked for their birthday.

As a game mechanics: Let the players throw dice to decide their \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrological_sign}{Astrological sign}. This is ow displayed together with the character name for everyone using a Hive controller above the characters head.
All the Überlingen inhabitants and the AI will treat the personal traits connected to the sign as absolute truth. "Of course you are upset. You are Scorpion". This is funny if it matches the way the character is designed - or if it clashes with it.

\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{ccccc}
    \hline
    Rolled & Sign & Gemstone & positive char & negative char \\ [0.5ex]
    \hline
    1 & Ram & Red Jasper & Courageous & Self-centred   \\
    2 & Bull & Amber & Loyal & Stubborn   \\
    3 & Twins & Pyrite & Curious & Superficial  \\
    4 & Crab & Rutile & Sensitive & Anxious  \\
    5 & Lion & Citrine & Righteous & Proud  \\
    6 & Maiden & Lizardite & Reliable & Petty  \\
    7 & Scales & Jade & Just & Depressive  \\
    8 & Scorpion & Turquoise & Determined & Authoritarian  \\
    9 & Archer & Chalcedony & Optimistic & Overconfident  \\
    10 & Goat & Rock crystal & Ambitious & Gluttonous  \\
    11 & Water-bearer & Aquamarine & Honest & Vain  \\
    12 & Fish & Rose Quartz & Patient & Lazy  \\
\end{tabularx}

\subsection{Birds aren't real - if it flies, it spies !}

To gather more information the AI is measuring the samples from the toilet and is spying on people using \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birds_Aren%27t_Real}{artificial birds} - google for it to find great posters and handouts !
This way the AI knows everything about the health and secret wishes of everyone in Überlingen.

When spending time in Überlingen especially the Lost characters will find the birds "strange" without really knowing why.

The most common birds are seagulls, followed by crows.

\subsection{Working miracles}

There is lots of esoteric show and rituals in the population. Some is automated. Water tabs have a revolver style apparatus of 12 transparent pipes containing all twelve gemstones. When someone fetches tap water the Hive controller automatically rotates the right pipe in place so the water can be energetizised by the proper crystal.
Of course the real magic is done by the medicine secretly added to the water - optimised for the person consuming it. This can be caffein, pain killers, the daily dose of the medical drugs they need to treat the illness, ...

Of course you can order "full moon beer" at the Ceres (which was brewed by the automated Ceres system during full moon). And spring flower tea (adopted to your personal aura). There is always an ayurvedic food option - and the Hive controller will help you picking the right dish.

This is the only Ceres where you can order Yak milk in Germany (it is still a mystery who got the Yak cells for the bio tank). But some drops in your tea will set your chakras right.

The AI will generate daily horoscopes for the people. And like a miracle they will turn out to be true - AI's stage magic at work.

\subsection{People in Überlingen}

People in Überlingen are friendly and the visitors will be invited to parties inside their buildings or a the shore of the lake. They will spend a great time there. But they will have to get used to how things are done here. At least everything is very mindful.


\subsection{Scientific underground}

There is a small group of activists who want to spread the truth by teaching the scientific method. And unveil the mischiefs of the AI. The call themselves \hyperref[sec:Scientific Underground]{Scientific Underground}.


The AI is aware of them and accepts them - as long as they keep a low profile. Because they can identify the doubters and make them move to another Hive. Improving the happiness score.
Still they do not stop handying out flyers, doing small science sessions with the esoteric audience and pointing out that the birds are behaving strange. Not many take them serious here in Überlingen.

\section{Pirates}

Two groups of Pirates are threatening the Lake of Constance region. Both seem to have their base in the Suisse. And both are speaking Suisse dialect. But they have a different philosophy and are enemies.

\subsection{Rakham}

He is a show pirate, inspired by Captain Jack Sparrow. His wooden ship sometimes "visits" Überlingen and other cities where he and his crew rob from the people. When his black flag is seen approaching Überlingen the people gather at the beach. Finally a good show. And the few items the might lose to the pirate can be replaced by the AI.

\subsection{Blackbeard}

He converted the old ferries and katamarans to look like vehicles from a Mad Max film. His fleet is feared on the Lake of Constance and he is a threat. Of course he dispises Rakham and his crew. His current goal is to find out what the treasure is the Acolythes are searching.

\section{Waterworld}

Waterwold is a swimming city built by the Pioneers from Weingarten. It is a collection of bouncy castle style floats in all colours of the rainbow. Some with an incredible size. Traffic between is by boat. No one check film history when naming it that way. But so far everything is fine.

The Pioneers here focus their research on water life, ship technology and building bouncy things like buildings and platforms. Some of those swimming floats are used as gardens.

Every evening there is a party where new engineering tricks and research outcome is presented. This time it is a new experiment with supercavitation. After that (and when everyone is drunken) there is a round of tattoo-secret-santa (all the players and the GM draw tattoos on post it. They are shuffled and the characters get a tattoo upgrade based on what the players draw)

They keep the pirates away with water cannons.

\subsection{Sea witch}

One special person in the Pioneer camp is the mysterious sea witch. She lives in her floating tower with spooky decoration. As counter balance to the tower above the floating plastic island there is a 3 story cellar below the surface of the lake.

Anyone who visits has to follow a ritualistic protocol to announce themselves. She herself also follows lots of ritualistic steps no one can decode. But she is a genius - very likely someone the protagonists will need.
The truth behind her behaviour: She is neuro divergent. No one properly diagnosed all her special modes of thinking and their reasons. But everyone found out she needs structure and surprises can take her out of the game for days.
Without concious decisions those small strange rituals developed between her and the rest of the Pioneers. Everyone is proud to have a sea witch and by following the rituals they build up a healthy structure.

Her small secret project is to build robotic birds for the Überlingen AI. The AI started to order them a few years ago. The sea witch does not care for what they are used but loves the challenge. If the Protagonists learn about this secret they can have 1-2 birds they can remote control as surveillance drones.

\subsection{Submarine}

The Pioneers here experiment with everything that swims or dives - what they are missing is a ready to use submarine. But with the help of the protagonists they can finish one. If you want to nerd-flash you players, watch \href{https://media.ccc.de/v/37c3-11828-how_to_build_a_submarine_and_survive}{How to build a submarine and survive} (in the options there is an English audio track).

To build a submarine they first need a tank strong enough to survive the water pressure. \hyperref[subsec:Friedrichshafen]{Friedrichshafen} as an industry town could have some. Maybe the opportunity to visit another town at the Lake of Constance and add a small adventure ?

\subsection{The body}

When everyone is happy a floating body is found. The person died from torture. The pirates found the Acoylte of the invisible hand, level 3, searching for something - the secret bunker. But assumed it is a simple treasure. This is why the tortured and killed him. The Hive controller was lost in the lake. The Protagonists can find it floating there. Maybe they call the master with it or the master will come searching for it soon anyway.
The dead Acolythe can be identified by the coin in the pocket. But as the Acolyte is no master - and has no brain implant - he could not have opened the bunker.

\subsection{The master}

The dead Acolythe was sent by the master to search for signs of the bunker. A few hours after the body was found the master will be rowed from Überlingen to Waterworld. By 4 people he paid for rowing. He will meet the protagonists, investigate the death of his servant and after learning that he failed finding the bunker pay the protagonists (with Euro) to go and search for the bunker now.
This will very likely lead to ....emotional responses....by the protagonists. But learning about what they are asked to search for they will accept - more out of curiosity and to prevent any damage the master could do than for the money.

\section{The bunker}

Knowing the area the dead Acolyth searched in and building a submarine together with the Pioneers the protagonists can start searching. 100m under the surface they will find a concrete bunker with the number "503".
The underwater airlock can only be opened by the Master and his implant. So after finding it the protagonists will have to shuttle him down there.

Once opened they will find a luxury apartment. Marble, gold, potted plants and elephant heads mounted to the wall. The worst James Bond villain bunker imaginable. They will be greeted by the old butler Nestor who spent the last 20 years locked into this bunker to keep it ready. Now that the guests are here Nestor hopes his shares will be paid out by the CEO (billionair) he is serving. But returning to the surface he will soon learn there is no existing market anymore...
Thanks to his personal brain implant he is still always happy and gets an endorphine flush as soon as he is discussing capitalism and financial theory.

There is a meeting room where the Acolythe and very likely also the protagonsist can now have a video audience with the CEO. He will just have to launch the buoy with the satellite dish to contact the moon base.

As soon as the video call works: The old CEO can be seen on screen. Behind him a techno utopia - and through a window the moon surface. Whenever the CEO moves it can be seen that this is a video background and the reality up there seems to be a tech desaster.

He will ask his lackeys who things are on earth - The acolythe will answer the way the CEO expects: A shattered mankind. Small islands of something like civilisation. Culture is on the Marxist spectrum. But his Acolythes are ready and well organised to take control (here he is lying). The sub groups among the Marxists he identified are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item {Norms: High tech and dependent on AI. But for those he already is armed with computer viruses. Soft targets}
    \item {Pioneers: Innovative on the tech level. But not business ready and they can be exploited. He would just bait them with ressources for their experiments. They do not patent on their ideas !}
    \item {Lost: A violent bunch of people, No culture but weapons. Low tech. Tribal. Maybe we just wait till they just die -  should be less than a few years.}
\end{itemize}

The CEO will then open one vault room (there are three) by remote and the Nestor will give the Acolythe the content (and this Acolythe will pay his employees the protagonists to carry the valuables to the submarine).

This locker room contains everything the Acolythes need to conquer earth for the CEO.

\begin{itemize}
    \item {2 Euro pallets of cash}
    \item {3 Euro pallets of guns, ammo and arms}
    \item {Leather shoes and business suits}
    \item {A map of fossil resources and plans how to extract them}
\end{itemize}

The last item is the world shattering weapon. Should people start to fall back to fossil ressources - not monitored by the UN - this can be the end of civilisation.

Not it is up to the protagonists. If they just leave with the submarine and Nestor and the Acolythe master stay trapped in the bunker (prefereably with the antenna cut) this is an option.

\section{Calling the UN}

The smartest next move is to inform the UN about this bunker - and the hundreds of others not yet found. It will be hard to get a connection to Africa - not satellites - but the UN ambassador will be shocked and ask the protagonists for help.

Not able to find all bunkers the societies must be made resilient to the attack be the CEOs. Preferably without telling them about the threat itself. Because no one will believe them. Lost, Norm and Pioneer societies must be strengthened. Networks between must be built. And a first project will be to travel south and build radio relay station between the UN in Africa and every society they find.

They should also try to find the mysterious Alexandria the Lost have built.

This will lead into a quest of loosly connected missions. The goal is to befriend and help as many Lost, Norm and Pioneer communities as possible. To have access to their support when the CEOs make their next move.

Those adventures can be connected in a "collect the coupon style". Where the protagonists can pick any adventure from a list of options. And as a reward getting gratitude they can accumulate. Or old books they can exchange for the ticket to Alexandria - As soon as the group has enough books that interest the Lost they will be invited to Alexandria.

\section{Green zone (end)}

The protagonists can spend a few days in Waterworld or Überlingen. Meet the friends they made.
