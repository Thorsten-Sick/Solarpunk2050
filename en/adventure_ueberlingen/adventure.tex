\chapter{To the moon}
\label{ch:To the moon}

\section{Topic}

Hunting the billionairs the protagonists arrive in Überlingen. Meeting a strange esoteric culture. Here they will have to decide how to handle facts, freedom and the fate of the people.
One step closer to the hideout of the billionair they will meet the Pioneer community that fled Weingarten: Waterworld.

Here they will encounter the body of a Acolyte of the invisible hand who searched for the hideout - killed by Pirates on the Lake of Constance.

Hired by the Master Acolythe the pioneers will have to build a submarine themselves (maybe with the help of the sea witch).

Deep under the surface of the Lake of Constance the billionairs built a bunker. Occupied by Nestor - a loyal servant of his master.

The master himself is on the moon. Waiting for an Acolyte to succeed in finding the bunker. In a video conference the protagonists can speak to one of the villains directly - for the first time.

They can get access to one of the locked safes in the bunker - containing enough tools to capitalism-form the earth making it ready for the return of the billionairs.

They will also learn that this is just one of hundreds of hidden bunkers the billionairs left behind for their servants. This is the best time to contact the UN, raise the red alert and be ready to receive their next task from the UN:

Assemble as many Norms, Pioneers and Lost as possible. Enable them to face the billionairs should they return. But without telling them the truth - because this does not sound credible.

\section{What really happened}

The billionairs left for the moon. All of them. They left hundreds of secret bunkers behind. With all the tools to required to capitalism-form earth. The protagonist will find one at the end of the adventure. And will have the power to end Solarpunk.
Or help the UN prepare everyone to fight back what will be the counter revolution. Which will start as soon as an Acolythe of the invisible hand controls one of those bunkers.

To reach the bunker the protagonists will explore the Überlingen environment:
\begin{itemize}
    \item {Überlingen, the esoteric town at the shore of the Lake of Constance. Miracles work here !}
    \item {}
\end{itemize}


\section{Überlingen (green zone where it starts)}

The AI uses technology, science and applied stage magic to make miracles work. The esoteric inhabitants are cheated by that - and happy.

\subsection{Astrological signs}

Upon arrival everyone with a Hive controller will be asked for their birthday.

As a game mechanics: Let the players throw dice to decide their \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrological_sign}{Astrological sign}. This is ow displayed together with the character name for everyone using a Hive controller above the characters head.
All the Überlingen inhabitants and the AI will treat the personal traits connected to the sign as absolute truth. "Of course you are upset. You are Scorpion". This is funny if it matches the way the character is designed - or if it clashes with it.

\subsection{Birds aren't real}

To gather more information the AI is measuring the samples from the toilet and is spying on people using \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birds_Aren%27t_Real}{artificial birds} - google for it to find great posters and handouts !

\subsection{Scientific underground}

\section{Pirates}

\section{Waterworld}

\subsection{Science party}

They experiment with everything that swims or dives - what they are missing is a ready to use submarine. But with the help of the protagonists they can finish one. If you want to nerd-flash you players, watch \href{https://media.ccc.de/v/37c3-11828-how_to_build_a_submarine_and_survive}{How to build a submarine and survive} (in the options there is an English audio track).

    \begin{npcDescription}
    An impulsive architect, he has a spire with a house on it. He is trying to cultivate the side of the rock by attaching small boxes for plants.
    He was part of the 5 minute riot that Kim escaped from. Being impulsive, he threw rocks at the three Project Lifeguard people. The cyborg followed Kim. A rock thrown by Leo hit an engineer, throwing him off a bridge and killing him. Sam, the third engineer, was hiding in their bunker. An antenna was destroyed by rocks thrown.
    After the rebellion turned bloody, Leo retreated. Shocked by his own actions.
    If this can be fixed, they can gain the support of a skilled architect who only lacks the tools to build fantastic vertical gardens and bridges.

    Leo is 60 years old and remembers the time before the disaster. He moved to Albstadt 2 years before the disaster. Leo studied engineering and architecture before moving there.

    \textbf{Location:} His own spire. With a small house (repaired). And a small hanging garden at the side of the spire (just some flower pots, he did not have the right tools for proper hanging gardens).

    \textbf{Problem:} Has to deal with killing someone. Maybe talking to Sam will help.

    \textbf{When convinced:} Can help build things (a real hanging garden, real suspension bridges, crab traps)
